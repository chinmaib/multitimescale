In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating stationary policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize problems in time. However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with the tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model distributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning algorithm. Framing RL as sequence modeling problem simplifies a range of design decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL. Further, we show that this approach can be combined with existing model-free algorithms to yield a state-of-the-art planner in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks.},

	abstract = {Motor imagery (MI) signals recorded via electroencephalography (EEG) is the most convenient basis for designing brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). As MI based BCI provides high degree of freedom, it helps motor disabled people to communicate with the device by performing sequence of MI tasks. But inter-subject variability, extracting user-specific features and increasing accuracy of the classifier is still a challenging task in MI based BCIs. In this work, we propose an approach to overcome the above mentioned issues. The proposed approach follows the pipeline such as channel selection, band-pass filter based CSP (common spatial pattern), feature extraction, feature selection using two different techniques and modeling using Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB) classifier. Since the optimal features are selected by feature selection techniques, it helps to overcome inter-subject variability and improves performance of GNB classifier. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed methodology has not been used for MI-based BCI applications. The proposed approach is validated using BCI competition III dataset IVa. The result of our proposed approach is compared with two conventional classifiers such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM). The results prove that the proposed method provides an improved accuracy than LDA and SVM classifiers. The proposed method can be further developed to design a reliable and real-time MI-based BCI application.},

Transfer learning and domain adaptation have been extensively used for this purpose. However, most previous works focused on classification problems. This paper considers an important regression problem in BCI, namely, online driver drowsiness estimation from EEG signals. By integrating fuzzy sets with domain adaptation, we propose a novel online weighted adaptation regularization for regression (OwARR) algorithm to reduce the amount of subject-specific calibration data, and also a source domain selection (SDS) approach to save about half of the computational cost of OwARR. Using a simulated driving dataset with 15 subjects, we show that OwARR and OwARR-SDS can achieve significantly smaller estimation errors than several other approaches.

In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method—electroencephalography (EEG)—can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.},

	abstract = {"A First Course in Machine Learning by Simon Rogers and Mark Girolami is the best introductory book for ML currently available. It combines rigor and precision with accessibility, starts from a detailed explanation of the basic foundations of Bayesian analysis in the simplest of settings, and goes all the way to the frontiers of the subject such as infinite mixture models, GPs, and MCMC."—Devdatt Dubhashi, Professor, Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Chalmers University, Sweden
"This textbook manages to be easier to read than other comparable books in the subject while retaining all the rigorous treatment needed. The new chapters put it at the forefront of the field by covering topics that have become mainstream in machine learning over the last decade."—Daniel Barbara, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia, USA
"The new edition of A First Course in Machine Learning by Rogers and Girolami is an excellent introduction to the use of statistical methods in machine learning. The book introduces concepts such as mathematical modeling, inference, and prediction, providing ‘just in time’ the essential background on linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory that the reader needs to understand these concepts."—Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo, Associate Professor, Aalborg University Esbjerg, Denmark
"I was impressed by how closely the material aligns with the needs of an introductory course on machine learning, which is its greatest strength…Overall, this is a pragmatic and helpful book, which is well-aligned to the needs of an introductory course and one that I will be looking at for my own students in coming months."—David Clifton, University of Oxford, UK
"The first edition of this book was already an excellent introductory text on machine learning for an advanced undergraduate or taught masters level course, or indeed for anybody who wants to learn about an interesting and important field of computer science. The additional chapters of advanced material on Gaussian process, MCMC and mixture modeling provide an ideal basis for practical projects, without disturbing the very clear and readable exposition of the basics contained in the first part of the book."　—Gavin Cawley, Senior Lecturer, School of Computing Sciences, University of East Anglia, UK
"This book could be used for junior/senior undergraduate students or first-year graduate students, as well as individuals who want to explore the field of machine learning…The book introduces not only the concepts but the underlying ideas on algorithm implementation from a critical thinking perspective."—Guangzhi Qu, Oakland University, Rochester, Michigan, USA},

One particular practice that has become common is ‘reverse inference’, by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak.},

The primary goal of moving this approach forward is to gauge if, with reasonable probability, it is possible to train classiﬁers across many subjects. The main reason of using CNNs is that most other classiﬁers require feature engineering and pre-processing. With the use of neural networks, we avoid this and attempt to show, via comparison with a baseline SVM classiﬁer (which has feature extraction done), that CNNs can perform better even with raw data input. We show our different approaches to model these classiﬁers and report our results which encapsulate the degree of success achieved over 9 different subjects’ fMRI data.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful new instrument to collect vast quantities of data about activity in the human brain. A typical fMRI experiment can produce a three-dimensional image related to the human subject's brain activity every half second, at a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, this new instrumentation has led to a flood of new data, and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. We describe recent research applying machine learning methods to the problem of classifying the cognitive state of a human subject based on fRMI data observed over a single time interval. In particular, we present case studies in which we have successfully trained classifiers to distinguish cognitive states such as (1) whether the human subject is looking at a picture or a sentence, (2) whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or non-ambiguous sentence, and (3) whether the word the subject is viewing is a word describing food, people, buildings, etc. This learning problem provides an interesting case study of classifier learning from extremely high dimensional (105 features), extremely sparse (tens of training examples), noisy data. This paper summarizes the results obtained in these three case studies, as well as lessons learned about how to successfully apply machine learning methods to train classifiers in such settings.},

First, buyers often have irregular purchase patterns, as the authors observe in the high-tech industry. Second, marketing efforts take considerable time to build a relationship with a customer. The authors attempt to precisely recover hidden buyer–seller relationship states to capture the effect of marketing contacts in B2B markets. The authors build a comprehensive hierarchical Bayesian bivariate Tobit hidden Markov model to assess the return on marketing in B2B markets. They use a recursive computing method—a forward–backward Gibbs sampler method—to retrieve the relationship states. The results suggest that marketing contacts have a heterogeneous long- and short-term impact on customers' purchasing behavior through changes in the buyer–seller relationship states. This study provides practical value to business marketers to measure the return on marketing investment in buyer–seller relationships.},

The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning–based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6\% price cut for boosting conversion.},

We develop BrandImageNet, a multi-label deep convolutional neural network model, to predict the presence of perceptual brand attributes in the images consumers post online. We validate BrandImageNet model performance using human judges and find a high degree of agreement between our model and human evaluations of images. We apply the BrandImageNet model to brand-related images posted on social media to extract brand portrayal based on model predictions for 56 national brands in the apparel and beverages categories. We find a strong link between brand portrayal in consumer-created images and consumer brand perceptions collected through traditional survey tools. Firms can use the BrandImageNet model to automatically monitor their brand portrayal in real time and better understand consumer brand perceptions and attitudes toward their and competitors’ brands.},

	abstract = {Most brain research to date have focused on studying the amplitude of evoked fMRI responses, though there has recently been an increased interest in measuring onset, peak latency and duration of the responses as well. A number of modeling procedures provide measures of the latency and duration of fMRI responses. In this work we compare several techniques that vary in their assumptions, model complexity, and interpretation. For each method, we introduce methods for estimating amplitude, peak latency, and duration and for performing inference in a multi-subject fMRI setting. We then assess the techniques' relative sensitivity and their propensity for mis-attributing task effects on one parameter (e.g., duration) to another (e.g., amplitude). Finally, we introduce methods for quantifying model misspecification and assessing bias and power-loss related to the choice of model. Overall, the results show that it is surprisingly difficult to accurately recover true task-evoked changes in BOLD signal and that there are substantial differences among models in terms of power, bias and parameter confusability. Because virtually all fMRI studies in cognitive and affective neuroscience employ these models, the results bear on the interpretation of hemodynamic response estimates across a wide variety of psychological and neuroscientific studies.},

For instance, if a pencil or a facial tissue is imbued with scent (vs. not), recall for the brand's other attributes increases significantly—with the effects lasting as much as 2 weeks after exposure. We also find that product scent is more effective than ambient scent at enhancing memory for product information. We suggest that this may be because, with product (ambient) scent, scent-related associations are focused on a single object (are diffused across multiple objects) in the environment. In support, we find that the memory effects are driven by the number of product/scent-related associations stored in long-term memory. The results suggest that, although ambient scent has received the bulk of attention from researchers and managers in recent years, greater focus on product scent is warranted.},

We characterized two types of deviations from the optimal investment strategy of a rational risk-neutral agent as risk-seeking mistakes and risk-aversion mistakes. Nucleus accumbens activation preceded risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes.

Scientifically, substantial progress has been made in understanding the neurobiology of choice processes. Further advances, however, require researchers to begin clarifying the set of developmental and cognitive processes that shape and constrain choices. First, despite the centrality of preferences in theories of consumer choice, we still know little about where preferences come from and the underlying developmental processes. Second, the role of attention and memory processes in consumer choice remains poorly understood, despite importance ascribed to them in interpreting data from the field. The applied goal of consumer neuroscience concerns our ability to translate this understanding to augment prediction at the population level. Although the use of neuroscientific data for market-level predictions remains speculative, there is growing evidence of superiority in specific cases over existing market research techniques.},

Anderson, 1994) as well as working memory (digit span) and behavioral inhibition (go/no-go) tasks. Cross-sectional age-related changes were seen on all 3 tasks. Gender differences were seen in IGT deck preference and attentional variables (i.e., go/no-go hit rate and forward digit span). After age, gender, and general intellectual abilities were controlled for, IGT performance was not predicted by working memory or behavioral inhibition scores. Findings suggest that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex or its connections are functionally maturing during adolescence in a manner that can be distinguished from maturation of other prefrontal regions. Development of these functions may continue into young adulthood. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Third, much of experience is ambiguous, but not recognized as such. Experience supports a pseudodiagnosticity that draws the consumer in as a willing partner in the seduction.

	abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) studies constitute a growing proportion of functional brain imaging publications. This approach detects temporal correlations in spontaneous blood oxygen level–dependent (BOLD) signal oscillations while subjects rest quietly in the scanner. Although distinct resting-state networks related to vision, language, executive processing, and other sensory and cognitive domains have been identified, considerable skepticism remains as to whether resting-state functional connectivity maps reflect neural connectivity or simply track BOLD signal correlations driven by nonneural artifact. Here we combine diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography with resting-state fcMRI to test the hypothesis that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity. These 2 modalities were used to investigate connectivity within the default mode network, a set of brain regions—including medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), medial temporal lobes (MTLs), and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC)/retropslenial cortex (RSC)—implicated in episodic memory processing. Using seed regions from the functional connectivity maps, the DTI analysis revealed robust structural connections between the MTLs and the retrosplenial cortex whereas tracts from the MPFC contacted the PCC (just rostral to the RSC). The results demonstrate that resting-state functional connectivity reflects structural connectivity and that combining modalities can enrich our understanding of these canonical brain networks.},

	abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in memory circuit function in humans suffering from memory disorders. Since the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, a number of studies, reviewed here, have focused on this region of the brain. By the time individuals are diagnosed clinically with AD dementia, the substantial memory impairments appear to be associated with not only MTL atrophy but also hypoactivation during memory task performance. Prior to dementia, when individuals are beginning to manifest signs and symptoms of memory impairment, the hippocampal formation and other components of the MTL memory system exhibit substantial functional abnormalities during memory task performance. It appears that, early in the course of MCI when memory deficits and hippocampal atrophy are less prominent, there may be hyperactivation of MTL circuits, possibly representing inefficient compensatory activity. Later in the course of MCI, when considerable memory deficits are present, MTL regions are no longer able to activate during attempted learning, as is the case in AD dementia. Recent fMRI data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. As this work continues to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the incorporation of measures of task-related brain function into diagnostic assessment or therapeutic monitoring, such as for use in clinical trials.},

Laboratory and field evidence suggests that people often avoid risks with losses even when they might earn a substantially larger gain, a behavioral preference termed “loss aversion.” The cautionary brake on behavior known to rely on the amygdala is a plausible candidate mechanism for loss aversion, yet evidence for this idea has so far not been found. We studied two rare individuals with focal bilateral amygdala lesions using a series of experimental economics tasks. To measure individual sensitivity to financial losses we asked participants to play a variety of monetary gambles with possible gains and losses. Although both participants retained a normal ability to respond to changes in the gambles’ expected value and risk, they showed a dramatic reduction in loss aversion compared to matched controls. The findings suggest that the amygdala plays a key role in generating loss aversion by inhibiting actions with potentially deleterious outcomes.},

Current word embedding-based approaches treat each stimulus word independently and thus ignore the influence of context on language understanding. In this work, we instead build encoding models using rich contextual representations derived from an LSTM language model. Our models show a significant improvement in encoding performance relative to state-of-the-art embeddings in nearly every brain area. By varying the amount of context used in the models and providing the models with distorted context, we show that this improvement is due to a combination of better word embeddings learned by the LSTM language model and contextual information. We are also able to use our models to map context sensitivity across the cortex. These results suggest that LSTM language models learn high-level representations that are related to representations in the human brain.},

	abstract = {Despite the substantial economic impact of the restaurant industry, large-scale empirical research on restaurant survival has been sparse. We investigate whether consumer-posted photos can serve as a leading indicator of restaurant survival above and beyond reviews, firm characteristics, competitive landscape, and macro conditions. We employ machine learning techniques to extract features from 755,758 photos and 1,121,069 reviews posted on Yelp between 2004 and 2015 for 17,719 U.S. restaurants. We also collect data on restaurant characteristics (e.g., cuisine type; price level), competitive landscape, as well as entry and exit (if applicable) time from each restaurant’s Yelp/Facebook page, own website, or Google search engine. Using a predictive XGBoost algorithm, we find that consumer-posted photos are strong predictors of restaurant survival. Interestingly, the informativeness of photos (e.g., the proportion of food photos) relates more to restaurant survival than do photographic attributes (e.g., composition; brightness). Additionally, photos carry more predictive power for independent, young or mid-aged, and medium-priced restaurants. Assuming that restaurant owners possess no knowledge about future photos and reviews, photos can predict restaurant survival for up to three years, while reviews are only predictive for one year. We further employ causal forests to facilitate the interpretation of our predictive results. Among photo content variables, the proportion of food photos has the largest positive association with restaurant survival, followed by proportions of outside and interior photos. Among others, the proportion of photos with helpful votes also positively relates to restaurant survival.},

	abstract = {Firms traditionally rely on interviews and focus groups to identify customer needs for marketing strategy and product development. User-generated content (UGC) is a promising alternative source for identifying customer needs. However, established methods are neither efficient nor effective for large UGC corpora because much content is noninformative or repetitive. We propose a machine-learning approach to facilitate qualitative analysis by selecting content for efficient review. We use a convolutional neural network to filter out noninformative content and cluster dense sentence embeddings to avoid sampling repetitive content. We further address two key questions: Are UGC-based customer needs comparable to interview-based customer needs? Do the machine-learning methods improve customer-need identification? These comparisons are enabled by a custom data set of customer needs for oral care products identified by professional analysts using industry-standard experiential interviews. The analysts also coded 12,000 UGC sentences to identify which previously identified customer needs and/or new customer needs were articulated in each sentence. We show that (1) UGC is at least as valuable as a source of customer needs for product development, likely more valuable, compared with conventional methods, and (2) machine-learning methods improve efficiency of identifying customer needs from UGC (unique customer needs per unit of professional services cost).

	abstract = {Previous studies have succeeded in identifying the cognitive state corresponding to the perception of a set of depicted categories, such as tools, by analyzing the accompanying pattern of brain activity, measured with fMRI. The current research focused on identifying the cognitive state associated with a 4s viewing of an individual line drawing (1 of 10 familiar objects, 5 tools and 5 dwellings, such as a hammer or a castle). Here we demonstrate the ability to reliably (1) identify which of the 10 drawings a participant was viewing, based on that participant's characteristic whole-brain neural activation patterns, excluding visual areas; (2) identify the category of the object with even higher accuracy, based on that participant's activation; and (3) identify, for the first time, both individual objects and the category of the object the participant was viewing, based only on other participants' activation patterns. The voxels important for category identification were located similarly across participants, and distributed throughout the cortex, focused in ventral temporal perceptual areas but also including more frontal association areas (and somewhat left-lateralized). These findings indicate the presence of stable, distributed, communal, and identifiable neural states corresponding to object concepts.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful new instrument to collect vast quantities of data about activity in the human brain. A typical fMRI experiment can produce a three-dimensional image related to the human subject's brain activity every half second, at a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. As in other modern empirical sciences, this new instrumentation has led to a flood of new data, and a corresponding need for new data analysis methods. We describe recent research applying machine learning methods to the problem of classifying the cognitive state of a human subject based on fRMI data observed over a single time interval. In particular, we present case studies in which we have successfully trained classifiers to distinguish cognitive states such as (1) whether the human subject is looking at a picture or a sentence, (2) whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or non-ambiguous sentence, and (3) whether the word the subject is viewing is a word describing food, people, buildings, etc. This learning problem provides an interesting case study of classifier learning from extremely high dimensional (105 features), extremely sparse (tens of training examples), noisy data. This paper summarizes the results obtained in these three case studies, as well as lessons learned about how to successfully apply machine learning methods to train classifiers in such settings.},

Recently, researchers have started to address this question by applying sophisticated pattern-classification algorithms to distributed (multi-voxel) patterns of functional MRI data, with the goal of decoding the information that is represented in the subject's brain at a particular point in time. This multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) approach has led to several impressive feats of mind reading. More importantly, MVPA methods constitute a useful new tool for advancing our understanding of neural information processing. We review how researchers are using MVPA methods to characterize neural coding and information processing in domains ranging from visual perception to memory search.},

Guidelines on when and how to employ triangulation methods on neuroimaging data are included.

Trials comprised an initial “prospect” (expectancy) phase, when a set of three monetary amounts was displayed, and a subsequent “outcome” phase, when one of these amounts was awarded. Hemodynamic responses in the sublenticular extended amygdala (SLEA) and orbital gyrus tracked the expected values of the prospects, and responses to the highest value set of outcomes increased monotonically with monetary value in the nucleus accumbens, SLEA, and hypothalamus. Responses to prospects and outcomes were generally, but not always, seen in the same regions. The overlap of the observed activations with those seen previously in response to tactile stimuli, gustatory stimuli, and euphoria-inducing drugs is consistent with a contribution of common circuitry to the processing of diverse rewards.},

We know little about whether brand betrayal is merely an extreme form of brand dissatisfaction or is a distinct state experienced differently from dissatisfaction. Herein, two studies shed new light into the experience of brand betrayal. A large-scale psychometric study shows that brand betrayal (vs. dissatisfaction) is associated with feelings of psychological loss, self-castigation over one’s prior relationship with the brand, indignation-focused versus frustration-focused anger, and rumination. A functional neuroimaging experiment further demonstrates that brand betrayal and brand dissatisfaction can be differentiated neurophysiologically, holding all else equal. These effects suggest that compared with brand dissatisfaction, brand betrayal is likely to be more harmful to both the brand and the brand relationship, and more difficult for marketers to deflect, with longer lasting consequences.},

Four studies show that offering consumers the choice between a full-sized food portion alone and a half-sized food portion paired with a small nonfood premium (e.g., a small Happy Meal toy or the mere possibility of winning frequent flyer miles) motivates smaller portion choice. Importantly, we investigate why this is the case and find that both food and the prospect of receiving a nonfood premium activate a common area of the brain (the striatum), which is associated with reward, desire, and motivation. Finally, we show that the choice results are mediated by a psychological desire for, but not by liking of, the premium. Notably, we find that choice of the smaller food portion is most pronounced when the probability of obtaining the premium is not disclosed compared to when the probability is disclosed or when the receipt of the same premium is stated as being certain. Taken together, motivating choice and consumption of less food may be successful if smaller portions are accompanied by an incentive.},

	abstract = {Given curiosity’s characterization as a motivational drive for knowledge, prior research has primarily focused on curiosity’s positive effects on knowledge exploration, information acquisition, and learning. Once the desired knowledge has been acquired, curiosity is said to be satisfied. But what happens if curiosity is left unsatisfied? Across five experiments, spanning four domains of indulgence-related decisions and relying on different methods of curiosity elicitation, the present research sheds light on an unexpected yet crucial consequence of curiosity—that unsatisfied curiosity tempts indulgent consumption in domains unrelated to the source of the curiosity. This effect is explained by a generalized desire for rewards. Experiments 1–3 establish and replicate the proposed mediation model of curiosity —› desire for rewards —› indulgence, employing manipulation-of-process, moderation-of-process, and measurement-of-process experimental designs. Experiment 4 utilizes neurophysiological data to indicate brain activation in the insular cortex for unsatisfied (vs. satisfied) curiosity. Experiment 5 addresses the role of cognitive depletion as a possible alternative mechanism. In summary, this article demonstrates that the hunger for information that accompanies unsatisfied curiosity is converted into a generalized desire for rewards, which in turn tempts indulgence.},

	abstract = {Currently, most real-world time series datasets are multivariate and are rich in dynamical information of the underlying system. Such datasets are attracting much attention; therefore, the need for accurate modelling of such high-dimensional datasets is increasing. Recently, the deep architecture of the recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variant long short-term memory (LSTM) have been proven to be more accurate than traditional statistical methods in modelling time series data. Despite the reported advantages of the deep LSTM model, its performance in modelling multivariate time series (MTS) data has not been satisfactory, particularly when attempting to process highly non-linear and long-interval MTS datasets. The reason is that the supervised learning approach initializes the neurons randomly in such recurrent networks, disabling the neurons that ultimately must properly learn the latent features of the correlated variables included in the MTS dataset. In this paper, we propose a pre-trained LSTM-based stacked autoencoder (LSTM-SAE) approach in an unsupervised learning fashion to replace the random weight initialization strategy adopted in deep LSTM recurrent networks. For evaluation purposes, two different case studies that include real-world datasets are investigated, where the performance of the proposed approach compares favourably with the deep LSTM approach. In addition, the proposed approach outperforms several reference models investigating the same case studies. Overall, the experimental results clearly show that the unsupervised pre-training approach improves the performance of deep LSTM and leads to better and faster convergence than other models.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Decision-making is the process of forming preferences for possible options, selecting and executing actions, and evaluating the outcome. This study used the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and the Prospect Valence Learning (PVL) model to investigate deficits in risk-reward related decision-making in patients with chronic schizophrenia, and to identify decision-making processes that contribute to poor IGT performance in these patients.

Materials and methods
Thirty-nine patients with schizophrenia and 31 healthy controls participated. Decision-making was measured by total net score, block net scores, and the total number of cards selected from each deck of the IGT. PVL parameters were estimated with the Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme in OpenBugs and BRugs, its interface to R, and the estimated parameters were analyzed with the Mann–Whitney U-test.

Results
The schizophrenia group received significantly lower total net scores compared to the control group. In terms of block net scores, an interaction effect of group × block was observed. The block net scores of the schizophrenia group did not differ across the five blocks, whereas those of the control group increased as the blocks progressed. The schizophrenia group obtained significantly lower block net scores in the fourth and fifth blocks of the IGT and selected cards from deck D (advantageous) less frequently than the control group. Additionally, the schizophrenia group had significantly lower values on the utility-shape, loss-aversion, recency, and consistency parameters of the PVL model.

Conclusion
These results indicate that patients with schizophrenia experience deficits in decision-making, possibly due to failure in learning the expected value of each deck, and incorporating outcome experiences of previous trials into expectancies about options in the present trial.},

Encoding models typically comprise a nonlinear transformation of stimuli to features (feature model) and a linear convolution of features to responses (response model). While there has been extensive work on developing better feature models, the work on developing better response models has been rather limited. Here, we investigate the extent to which recurrent neural network models can use their internal memories for nonlinear processing of arbitrary feature sequences to predict feature-evoked response sequences as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging. We show that the proposed recurrent neural network models can significantly outperform established response models by accurately estimating long-term dependencies that drive hemodynamic responses.

In this article, we report the results of two experiments which show that different types of past agreements can have different effects on the acceptance of current agent advice. In Study 1, we show that in addition to the overall agreement rate, consumers pay special attention to extreme opinion agreement when assessing agent diagnosticity (i.e., extremity effect). In Study 2 we show that positive extreme agreement is more influential than negative extreme agreement when advice valence is positive, but the converse does not hold when advice valence is negative (i.e., positivity effect). We conclude by identifying promising avenues for future research and discuss implications of the results for marketers in areas such as design of intelligent online recommendation systems and word-of-mouth management on the Internet.},

	abstract = {Although traditional economic and psychological theories imply that individual choice best scales to aggregate choice, primary components of choice reflected in neural activity may support even more generalizable forecasts. Crowdfunding represents a significant and growing platform for funding new and unique projects, causes, and products. To test whether neural activity could forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes weeks later, 30 human subjects (14 female) decided whether to fund proposed projects described on an Internet crowdfunding website while undergoing scanning with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Although activity in both the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) and medial prefrontal cortex predicted individual choices to fund on a trial-to-trial basis in the neuroimaging sample, only NAcc activity generalized to forecast market funding outcomes weeks later on the Internet. Behavioral measures from the neuroimaging sample, however, did not forecast market funding outcomes. This pattern of associations was replicated in a second study. These findings demonstrate that a subset of the neural predictors of individual choice can generalize to forecast market-level crowdfunding outcomes—even better than choice itself.
SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Forecasting aggregate behavior with individual neural data has proven elusive; even when successful, neural forecasts have not historically supplanted behavioral forecasts. In the current research, we find that neural responses can forecast market-level choice and outperform behavioral measures in a novel Internet crowdfunding context. Targeted as well as model-free analyses convergently indicated that nucleus accumbens activity can support aggregate forecasts. Beyond providing initial evidence for neuropsychological processes implicated in crowdfunding choices, these findings highlight the ability of neural features to forecast aggregate choice, which could inform applications relevant to business and policy.},

Research has not established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans. In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the success of those requests. We then established that neural activity (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample’s own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet. They also highlight affective neuroscience’s potential to probe neuropsychological mechanisms that drive microlending, enhance the effectiveness of loan requests, and forecast market-level behavior.},

They customize a neural network language model to derive latent product attributes by analyzing the co-occurrences of products in shopping baskets. Applying dimensionality reduction to the latent attributes yields a two-dimensional product map. This method is well-suited to retailers because it relies on data that are readily available from their checkout systems and facilitates their analyses of cross-category product complementarity, in addition to within-category substitution. The approach has high usability because it is automated, is scalable and does not require a priori assumptions. Its results are easy to interpret and update as new market basket data are collected. The authors validate their approach both by conducting an extensive simulation study and by comparing their results with those of state-of-the-art, econometric methods for modeling product relationships. The application of this approach using data collected at a leading German grocery retailer underlines its usefulness and provides novel findings that are relevant to assortment-related decisions.},

Time-varied fMRI signals plotted at points along the CLS showed that the signal was delayed systematically along the sulcus. Using 2 standard errors as a definition of reliable separation, the fMRI signal distinguished activation at points in the cortex separated by an average of 1.35 mm. Using the paradigm, 2 Ss were tested using a 24° stimulus. Results show the superior density and regularity of the fMRI results.

	abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) studies of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have begun to reveal abnormalities in memory circuit function in humans suffering from memory disorders. Since the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory system is a site of very early pathology in AD, a number of studies, reviewed here, have focused on this region of the brain. By the time individuals are diagnosed clinically with AD dementia, the substantial memory impairments appear to be associated with not only MTL atrophy but also hypoactivation during memory task performance. Prior to dementia, when individuals are beginning to manifest signs and symptoms of memory impairment, the hippocampal formation and other components of the MTL memory system exhibit substantial functional abnormalities during memory task performance. It appears that, early in the course of MCI when memory deficits and hippocampal atrophy are less prominent, there may be hyperactivation of MTL circuits, possibly representing inefficient compensatory activity. Later in the course of MCI, when considerable memory deficits are present, MTL regions are no longer able to activate during attempted learning, as is the case in AD dementia. Recent fMRI data in MCI and AD are beginning to reveal relationships between abnormalities of functional activity in the MTL memory system and in functionally connected brain regions, such as the precuneus. As this work continues to mature, it will likely contribute to our understanding of fundamental memory processes in the human brain and how these are perturbed in memory disorders. We hope these insights will translate into the incorporation of measures of task-related brain function into diagnostic assessment or therapeutic monitoring, such as for use in clinical trials.},

In Human Activity Recognition datasets, we note that the samples produced by the same subjects are likely to be correlated due to diverse factors. Hence, k-fold cross validation may overestimate the performance of activity recognizers, in particular when overlapping sliding windows are used. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Subject Cross Validation on the performance of Human Activity Recognition, both with non-overlapping and with overlapping sliding windows. Results show that k-fold cross validation artificially increases the performance of recognizers by about 10\%, and even by 16\% when overlapping windows are used. In addition, we do not observe any performance gain from the use of overlapping windows. We conclude that Human Activity Recognition systems should be evaluated by Subject Cross Validation, and that overlapping windows are not worth their extra computational cost.},

Based on this framework, we argue that the validity of fMRI studies can be improved by the triangulation of (1) careful design of neuroimaging studies and analyses of data, (2) meta-analyses, and (3) the integration of psychometric and behavioral data with neuroimaging data. Guidelines on when and how to employ triangulation methods on neuroimaging data are included. Moreover, we also included discussions on practices and research directions that validate fMRI studies in consumer neuroscience beyond data triangulation.},

	abstract = {BrainVoyager started as a simple fMRI analysis tool in the mid 1990s; the software was primarily created to fulfill the needs of its author and his colleagues to analyze anatomical and functional MRI data in a way that would be most appropriate for their research questions in visual and auditory perception. More specifically, the software was designed with three major goals in mind. First, it should allow analyses that would exploit optimally the high-resolution information available in fMRI data. Second, it should integrate volume-based analysis and cortex-based analysis including the possibility to visualize topographic activation data on flattened cortex representations. Third, it should combine hypothesis testing with data-driven analysis including interactive visualization tools that would make it as easy as possible to look at and explore data. A fourth guiding principle was to develop a software package that fulfilled the author's preference for elegant user interfaces, beautiful visualizations and high-performance computing. These major guiding principles from the beginning of BrainVoyager development are still noticeable in the most recent incarnations of the software that has grown from a small fMRI analysis tool on the Windows platform to a comprehensive cross-platform multi-modal software package integrating (real-time) fMRI, DWI/DTI, (i)EEG, MEG, TMS and fNIRS analyses.},

We propose a conceptual model and provide convergent evidence from 7 experiments to suggest that, in contrast to a typical “zero” reference point for choices on money, reference points for choices of experiences are set at more extreme outcomes, leading to concave utility for negative experiences but convex utility for positive experiences. As a result, people are more risk-averse for negative experiences such as disgusting foods—as for monetary gains—but more risk-seeking for positive experiences such as desserts—as for monetary losses. These risk preferences for experiences are robust to different methods of elicitation. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)},

Inspired by the recent success in applying deep learning for functional brain decoding and encoding, in this work we propose a spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (ST-CNN) to jointly learn the spatial and temporal patterns of targeted network from the training data and perform automatic, pin-pointing functional network identification. The proposed ST-CNN is evaluated by the task of identifying the Default Mode Network (DMN) from fMRI data. Results show that while the framework is only trained on one fMRI dataset, it has the sufficient generalizability to identify the DMN from different populations of data as well as different cognitive tasks. Further investigation into the results show that the superior performance of ST-CNN is driven by the jointly-learning scheme, which capture the intrinsic relationship between the spatial and temporal characteristic of DMN and ensures the accurate identification.},

These tasks are important for brain imaging and neuroscience discovery, making the methods attractive for porting to a neuroimager's toolbox. Success of these methods is, in part, explained by the flexibility of deep learning models. However, this flexibility makes the process of porting to new areas a difficult parameter optimization problem. In this work we demonstrate our results (and feasible parameter ranges) in application of deep learning methods to structural and functional brain imaging data. These methods include deep belief networks and their building block the restricted Boltzmann machine. We also describe a novel constraint-based approach to visualizing high dimensional data. We use it to analyze the effect of parameter choices on data transformations. Our results show that deep learning methods are able to learn physiologically important representations and detect latent relations in neuroimaging data.},

The primary goal of moving this approach forward is to gauge if, with reasonable probability, it is possible to train classiﬁers across many subjects. The main reason of using CNNs is that most other classiﬁers require feature engineering and pre-processing. With the use of neural networks, we avoid this and attempt to show, via comparison with a baseline SVM classiﬁer (which has feature extraction done), that CNNs can perform better even with raw data input. We show our different approaches to model these classiﬁers and report our results which encapsulate the degree of success achieved over 9 different subjects’ fMRI data.},

	abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating stationary policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize problems in time. However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with the tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model distributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning algorithm. Framing RL as sequence modeling problem simplifies a range of design decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and offline RL. Further, we show that this approach can be combined with existing model-free algorithms to yield a state-of-the-art planner in sparse-reward, long-horizon tasks.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

	abstract = {In this review we examined the emerging science of deterministic chaos (nonlinear systems theory) and its application to selected physiological systems. Although many of the popular images of fractals represent fascination and beauty that by analogy corresponds to nature as we see it, the question remains as to its ultimate meaning for physiological processes. It was our intent to help clarify this somewhat popular, somewhat obscure area of nonlinear dynamics in the context of an ever-changing procedural base. We examined not only the basic concepts of chaos, but also its applications ranging from observations in single cells to the complexity of the EEG. We have not suggested that nonlinear dynamics will answer all of our questions; however, we did attempt to illustrate ways in which this approach may help us to answer new questions and to rearticulate old ones. Chaos is revolutionary in that the overall approach requires us to adopt a different frame of reference which, at times, may move us away from previous concerns and methods of data analysis. In sections I-IV, we summarized the nonlinear dynamics approach and described its application to physiology and neural systems. First, we presented a general overview of the application of nonlinear dynamical techniques to neural systems. We discussed the manner in which even apparently simple deterministic systems can behave in an unpredictable manner. Second, we described the principles of nonlinear dynamical systems including the derived analytical techniques. We now see a variety of procedures for delineating whether frenetic chaotic behavior results from a nonlinear dynamical system with a few degrees of freedom, or whether it is caused by an infinite number of variables, i.e., noise. Third, we approached the applications of nonlinear procedures to the cardiovascular systems and to the neurosciences. In terms of time series, we described initial studies which applied the now "traditional" measures of dimensionality (e.g., based on the algorithm by Grassberger and Procaccia) and information change (e.g., Lyapunov exponents). Examples include our own work and that of Pritchard et al., demonstrating that the dynamics of neural mass activity reflect psychopathological states. Today, however, the trend has expanded to include the use of surrogate data and statistical null hypotheses testing to examine whether a given time series can be considered different from that of white or colored noise (cf. Ref. 262). One of the most important potential applications is that of quantifying changes in nonlinear dynamics to predict future states of the system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Prediction models use historical time series to predict future conditions that occur over periods of time. However, most of these models are shallow models, only containing a small number of non-linear operations and without the ability or the capacity to extract underlying features from complex time series accurately. Moreover, deep learning approaches outperform statistical and computational approaches if a large amount of data and/or hidden layers are involved in the development of a forecasting model, but they are criticized for their relatively slow learning speeds. Therefore, this research proposes a hybrid model, which is hybridized by empirical mode decomposition, stacked auto-encoders, and extreme learning machines, aiming to forecast wind speed accurately and efficiently. The evaluation is undertaken by conducting extensive experiments using real-world data. The results show that the proposed E-S-ELM can accurately and efficiently forecast wind speed, and the effectiveness of the shared-hidden-layer approach for deep networks is also demonstrated.},

This is achieved using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which, unlike conventional scale-estimation methods, obtains a set of scales reflecting the underlying oscillations at the intrinsic scale level. This enables the data-driven operation of several standard data-association measures (intrinsic correlation, intrinsic sample entropy (SE), intrinsic phase synchrony) and, at the same time, preserves the physical meaning of the analysis. The utility of multi-variate extensions of EMD is highlighted, both in terms of robust scale alignment between system components, a pre-requisite for inter-component measures, and in the estimation of feature relevance. We also illuminate that the properties of EMD scales can be used to decouple amplitude and phase information, a necessary step in order to accurately quantify signal dynamics through correlation and SE analysis which are otherwise not possible. Finally, the proposed multi-scale framework is applied to detect directionality, and higher order features such as coupling and regularity, in both synthetic and biological systems.},

Most BCI systems aim to help persons with serious movement disabilities, but BCIs for consumer applications are increasingly prevalent. Each year since 2010, teams submitted their BCI projects to the BCI Research Awards, where a jury decides the best projects of the year. We invite the nominees and winners of these awards to contribute chapters to our annual book series, and this book covers the 2020 BCI Research Awards—the tenth year of this award series, and the tenth book about the awards. Most of this book consists of chapters in which the authors summarize these BCI projects or contribute interviews about their work. In this chapter, we introduce BCIs, describe the procedures and people involved in the awards and books, and present the twelve projects that the jury nominated for an award.},

Predicting and intervening in these temporal interpersonal emotion systems (TIES) requires statistical models that represent complex, dynamic interdependencies across emotional subcomponents over time, both within individuals and between partners in an emotional transaction. Cross-disciplinary collaboration research team includes social and computational scientists working together to represent TIES theory in the form of testable mathematical models, a process we call "mindful modeling". The social scientists provide a theory about some aspect of TIES, along with relevant data, and the computational scientists provide a Bayesian generative model that embodies the key aspects of that theory, along with the ability to estimate the parameters of the model. A Bayesian generative model is a specification for the combine probability distribution of: observed data, parameters of a mathematical model, and latent variables.},

Currently, there is no neuropsychological probe to detect in the laboratory, and the cognitive and neural mechanisms responsible for this defect have resisted explanation. Here, using a novel task which simulates real-life decision-making in the way it factors uncertainty of premises and outcomes, as well as reward and punishment, we find that prefrontal patients, unlike controls, are oblivious to the future consequences of their actions, and seem to be guided by immediate prospects only. This finding offers, for the first time, the possibility of detecting these patients' elusive impairment in the laboratory, measuring it, and investigating its possible causes.},

The current review provides a critical examination of lesion, functional neuroimaging, developmental, and clinical studies in order to examine the construct validity of the IGT. The preponderance of evidence provides support for the use of the IGT to detect decision making deficits in clinical populations, in the context of a more comprehensive evaluation. The review includes a discussion of three critical issues affecting the validity of the IGT, as it has recently become available as a clinical instrument: the lack of a concise definition as to what aspect of decision making the IGT measures, the lack of data regarding reliability of the IGT, and the influence of personality and state mood on IGT performance.},

Given the fact that the process of mental rotation of objects is associated with desynchronisation of beta rhythm (beta ERD), it was expected that suppression in this band would be greater in the experimental group than in the controls. Thirty-three participants were randomly allocated to two groups performing the classic Shepard–Metzler mental rotation task (1971). The experimental group received auditory stimuli when the level of concentration fell below the threshold value determined separately for each participant based on the engagement index [β/(α + Θ)]. The level of concentration in the control group was not stimulated. Compared to the controls, the experimental group was found with greater beta-band suppression recorded above the left parietal cortex during the early stage and above the right parietal cortex during the late stage of mental rotation task. At the late stage of mental rotation, only the experimental group was found with differences in beta ERD related to varied degrees of the rotation angle and the control condition (zero angles, no rotation) recorded above the right parietal cortex and the central area of cerebral cortex. The present findings suggest that acoustic feedback might improve the process of mental rotation.},

Depression is associated with dysfunctional affective states, neuropsychological impairment and altered sensitivity to reward and punishment. These impairments can influence complex decision-making in changing environments.
Methods
The contingency shifting variant Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was used to assess flexible decision-making performance in a group of medicated unipolar Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) patients (n=19) and a group of healthy control volunteers (n=20). The task comprised the standard IGT followed by a contingency-shift phase where decks progressively changed reward and punishment schedule.
Results
Patients with MDD showed impaired performance compared to controls during both the standard and the contingency-shift phases of the IGT. Analysis of the contingency-shift phase demonstrated that individuals with depression had difficulties perceiving when a previously bad contingency became good.
Limitations
The present findings have several limitations including small sample size, the possible confounding role of medication and absence of other neuropsychological tests (i.e., executive function).
Conclusion
Depressed patients show impaired decision-making behaviour in static and dynamic environments. Altered sensitivity to reward and punishment is proposed as the mechanism responsible for the lack of advantageous choices and poor adjustment to a changing environment.},

	abstract = {The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) involves probabilistic learning via monetary rewards and punishments, where advantageous task performance requires subjects to forego potential large immediate rewards for small longer-term rewards to avoid larger losses. Pathological gamblers (PG) perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistent preference toward high, immediate, and uncertain rewards despite experiencing larger losses. In this contribution, we review studies that investigated processes associated with poor IGT performance in PG. Findings from these studies seem to fit with recent neurocognitive models of addiction, which argue that the diminished ability of addicted individuals to ponder short-term against long-term consequences of a choice may be the product of an hyperactive automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of addiction-related cues (e.g., high uncertain rewards associated with disadvantageous decks selection during the IGT) and for attributing to such cues pleasure and excitement. This incentive-salience associated with gambling-related choice in PG may be so high that it could literally “hijack” resources [“hot” executive functions (EFs)] involved in emotional self-regulation and necessary to allow the enactment of further elaborate decontextualized problem-solving abilities (“cool” EFs). A framework for future research is also proposed, which highlights the need for studies examining how these processes contribute specifically to the aberrant choice profile displayed by PG on the IGT.},

Problem gamblers are more likely to favor high-risk, high-reward, and short-term gains over more advantageous choice alternatives, and this preference has been linked to impaired learning about decision outcomes. In this paper we link specific learning processes in decision-making to specific harms related to problem gambling. We asked a group of 140 casual gamblers to 1) perform a canonical decision-making task (the Iowa Gambling Task) online, and 2) to complete a self-report survey (the GamTest) designed to measure self-perceived harm caused by their gambling. We used a reinforcement learning model to explain individual differences in the decision task, and related individuals’ model parameters to the specific problem areas reported using the questionnaire. We found that people who learned more from gains than from losses on the task were more likely to report overall gambling problems, and problems specifically related to money. We also found that people whose learning was more driven by the frequency of rewards were more likely to report problems related to the amount of time spent gambling, as well as social problems. We discuss possible psychological and neural processes mediating learning and gambling related harms, and we discuss the relevance of our approach to the diagnosis of problem gambling and its consequences.},

This makes predicting human decision making challenging to be treated agnostically to the underlying psychological mechanisms. We propose to use a recurrent neural network architecture based on long short-term memory networks (LSTM) to predict the time series of the actions taken by the human subjects at each step of their decision making, the first application of such methods in this research domain. We trained our prediction networks on the behavioral data from several published psychological experiments of human decision making, and demonstrated a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting human decision making trajectories in both single-agent scenarios such as Iowa Gambling Task and multi-agent scenarios such as Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.},

	abstract = {Negative Urgency (NU), a facet of impulsivity, refers to the tendency to act rashly when distressed. Impulsive traits are generally believed to impair decision-making, yet the relationship between NU and decision-making in situations of uncertainty remains underspecified. Therefore, this study examined the potential influence of NU on decision-making abilities as measured by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). It was further investigated whether additional audio-visual feedback leads to a superior performance in this task and whether this feedback alleviates the possible impairing effect of NU on decision-making.
While no association between NU and decision-making was found, only individuals with low NU showed a learning effect during the IGT, suggesting a non-linear relationship between those two constructs. Feedback did not improve IGT performance. Desirable approaches for further research are standardisation of NU scores, establishment of clinical cut-points and monitoring or induction of emotions during the IGT.},

	abstract = {Background: Psychopathy and substance use disorders (SUDs) are both characterized by neurocognitive impairments reflecting higher levels of impulsivity such as reward-driven decision-making and deficient inhibitory control. Previous studies suggest that psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits, but it may be unrelated to other neurocognitive impairments among substance dependent individuals (SDIs). The aim of the present study was to examine the role of psychopathy and its interpersonal-affective and impulsive-antisocial dimensions in moderating the relationships between dependence on different classes of drugs and neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.Method: We tested 693 participants (112 heroin mono-dependent individuals, 71 heroin polysubstance dependent individuals, 115 amphetamine mono-dependent individuals, 76 amphetamine polysubstance dependent individuals, and 319 non-substance dependent control individuals). Participants were administered the Psychopathy Checklist: Screening Version (PCL:SV) and seven neurocognitive tasks measuring impulsive choice/decision-making (Iowa Gambling Task; Cambridge Gambling Task; Kirby Delay Discounting Task; Balloon Analog Risk Task), and impulsive action/response inhibition (Go/No-Go Task, Immediate Memory Task, and Stop Signal Task).Results: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that the interpersonal-affective dimension of psychopathy moderated the association between decision-making, response inhibition and both amphetamine and heroin dependence, albeit differently. For amphetamine users, low levels of interpersonal-affective traits predicted poor decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task and better response inhibition on the Stop Signal task. In contrast, in heroin users high interpersonal-affective psychopathy traits predicted lower risk taking on the Cambridge Gambling Task and better response inhibition on the Go/No-Go task. The impulsive-antisocial dimension of psychopathy predicted poor response inhibition in both amphetamine and heroin users.Conclusions: Our findings reveal that psychopathy and its dimensions had both common and unique effects on neurocognitive function in heroin and amphetamine dependent individuals. Our results suggest that the specific interactions between psychopathy dimensions and dependence on different classes of drugs may lead to either deficient or superior decision-making and response inhibition performance in SDIs, suggesting that psychopathy may paradoxically play a protective role for some neurocognitive functions in specific subtypes of substance users.},

	abstract = {Although mounting neuroimaging studies have greatly improved our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying internet addiction (IA), the results based on traditional group-level comparisons are insufficient in guiding individual clinical practice directly. Specific neuroimaging biomarkers are urgently needed for IA diagnosis and the evaluation of therapy efficacy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop support vector machine (SVM) models to identify IA and assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based on unbiased functional connectivity density (FCD). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 27 individuals with IA before and after 8-week CBT sessions and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). The discriminative FCDs were computed as the features of the support vector classification (SVC) model to identify individuals with IA from HCs, and the changes in these discriminative FCDs after treatment were further used as features of the support vector regression (SVR) model to evaluate the efficacy of CBT. Based on the informative FCDs, our SVC model successfully differentiated individuals with IA from HCs with an accuracy of 82.5\% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Our SVR model successfully evaluated the efficacy of CBT using the FCD change ratio with a correlation efficient of 0.59. The brain regions contributing to IA classification and CBT efficacy assessment were the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), middle frontal cortex (MFC) and angular gyrus (AG), the right premotor cortex (PMC) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and the bilateral cerebellum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior frontal cortex (SFC). These findings confirmed the FCDs of hyperactive impulsive habit system, hypoactive reflecting system and sensitive interoceptive reward awareness system as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for IA, which might provide objective indexes for the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of IA.},

This cross-sectional study in New Zealand involved an online survey that utilised validated questionnaires to assess self-reported measures of concurrent disorders and the Iowa gambling task (IGT) to analyse decision-making. The study comprised of active EGM gamblers (n = 153) who were divided into two groups: non-problem gambling (NPG, n = 71) and problem gambling (PG, n = 82) based on the cut-off point of the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS). Multiple logistic regression models were performed to analyse co-occurring disorders separately and simultaneously, and a log‐linear model was developed to define the associations between significant variables. The first model showed a strong correlation between gambling severity and measures for depression (p {\textless} 0.01), anxiety (p {\textless} 0.05), stress (p {\textless} 0.05) and alcohol use (p {\textless} 0.01), however only depression (p {\textless} 0.05) and alcohol use (p {\textless} 0.01) remained significant in the second model. Further, no association between social anxiety scores and problem gambling was found in this sample of EGM gamblers in both models. On the IGT, EGM gamblers in the PG group performed significantly worse. Further, the presence of poor decision-making was more pronounced with higher depression scores (p {\textless} 0.01) across both NPG and PG groups and higher alcohol use scores (p {\textless} 0.05) scores in the PG group. The presence of high levels of co-occurring disorders and its link to poor decision-making are important considerations in the treatment paradigm of EGM problem gamblers.},

	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/ur8kn/},
	abstract = {Deep learning models, especially RNN models, are potentially powerful tools for representing the complex learning processes and decision-making strategies used by humans. Such neural network models make fewer assumptions about the underlying mechanisms thus providing experimental flexibility in terms of applicability. However this comes at the cost of requiring a larger number of tunable parameters requiring significantly more training and representative data for effective learning. This presents practical challenges given that most computational modelling experiments involve relatively small numbers of subjects, which while adequate for conventional modelling using low dimensional parameter spaces, leads to sub-optimal model training when adopting deeper neural network approaches. Laboratory collaboration is a natural way of increasing data availability however, data sharing barriers among laboratories as necessitated by data protection regulations encourage us to seek alternative methods for collaborative data science. Distributed learning, especially federated learning, which supports the preservation of data privacy, is a promising method for addressing this issue. To verify the reliability and feasibility of applying federated learning to train neural networks models used in the characterisation of human decision making, we conducted experiments on a real-world, many-labs data pool including experimentally significant data-sets from ten independent studies. The performance of single models that were trained on single laboratory data-sets was poor, especially those with small numbers of subjects. This unsurprising finding supports the need for larger and more diverse data-sets to train more generalised and reliable models. To that end we evaluated four collaborative approaches for comparison purposes. The first approach represents conventional centralized data sharing (CL-based) and is the optimal approach but requires complete sharing of data which we wish to avoid. The results however establish a benchmark for the other three distributed approaches; federated learning (FL-based), incremental learning (IL-based), and cyclic incremental learning (CIL-based). We evaluate these approaches in terms of prediction accuracy and capacity to characterise human decision-making strategies in the context of the computational modelling experiments considered here. The results demonstrate that the FL-based model achieves performance most comparable to that of a centralized data sharing approach.  This demonstrate that federated learning has value in scaling data science methods to data collected in computational modelling contexts in circumstances where data sharing is not convenient, practical or permissible.},

The present paper aims at critically examining those studies in which this task has been administered to PD patients, in order to understand possible anomalies in patients' decision processes and which variables are responsible for that. A meta-analysis has been conducted as well. Features of the task, sociodemographic and clinical aspects (including daily drugs intake), cognitive conditions and emotional disorders of the patients have been taken into account. Neural correlates of decision-making competences were considered. It emerged that PD patients show a trend of preference toward risky choices, probably due to an impairment in anticipating the unrewarding consequences or to an insensitiveness to punishment. The possible role played by dopamine medications in decision making under uncertain conditions, affecting basal ganglia and structures involved in the limbic loop, was discussed. Attention has been focused on some aspects that need to be investigated in further research, in order to delve into this issue and promote patients' quality of life.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          A good-based model proposes that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents binary choice outcome, i.e., the chosen good. Previous studies have found that the OFC represents the binary choice outcome in decision-making tasks involving commodity type, cost, risk, and delay. Real-life decisions are often complex and involve uncertainty, rewards, and penalties; however, whether the OFC represents binary choice outcomes in a such decision-making situation, e.g., Iowa gambling task (IGT), remains unclear. Here, we propose that the OFC represents binary choice outcome, i.e., advantageous choice versus disadvantageous choice, in the IGT. We propose two hypotheses: first, the activity pattern in the human OFC represents an advantageous choice; and second, choice induces an OFC-related functional network. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced machine learning tools, we found that the OFC represented an advantageous choice in the IGT. The OFC representation of advantageous choice was related to decision-making performance. Choice modulated the functional connectivity between the OFC and the superior medial gyrus. In conclusion, the OFC represents an advantageous choice during the IGT. In the framework of a good-based model, the results extend the role of the OFC to complex decision-making when making a binary choice.},

	abstract = {A novel multi-scale approach for quantifying both inter- and intra-component dependence of a complex system is introduced. This is achieved using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), which, unlike conventional scale-estimation methods, obtains a set of scales reflecting the underlying oscillations at the intrinsic scale level. This enables the data-driven operation of several standard data-association measures (intrinsic correlation, intrinsic sample entropy (SE), intrinsic phase synchrony) and, at the same time, preserves the physical meaning of the analysis. The utility of multi-variate extensions of EMD is highlighted, both in terms of robust scale alignment between system components, a pre-requisite for inter-component measures, and in the estimation of feature relevance. We also illuminate that the properties of EMD scales can be used to decouple amplitude and phase information, a necessary step in order to accurately quantify signal dynamics through correlation and SE analysis which are otherwise not possible. Finally, the proposed multi-scale framework is applied to detect directionality, and higher order features such as coupling and regularity, in both synthetic and biological systems.},

However, current researches on skeleton-based action recognition mainly focus on the natural connections of the skeleton and original temporal sequences of the skeleton frames, which ignore the inter-related relation of non-adjacent joints and the variant velocities of action instances. To overcome these limitations and therefore enhance the spatial and temporal features extraction for action recognition, we propose a novel Spatial Attention-Enhanced Multi-Timescale Graph Convolutional Network (SA-MTGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. Specifically, as the relation of non-adjacent but inter-related joints is beneficial for action recognition, we propose an Attention-Enhanced Spatial Graph Convolutional Network (A-SGCN) to use both natural connection and inter-related relation of joints. Furthermore, a Multi-Timescale (MT) structure is proposed to enhance temporal feature extraction by gathering different network layers to model different velocities of action instances. Experimental results on the two widely used NTU and Kinetics datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

	abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) modulates cortical neural activity and hemodynamics. Electrophysiological methods (electroencephalography-EEG) measure neural activity while optical methods (near-infrared spectroscopy-NIRS) measure hemodynamics coupled through neurovascular coupling (NVC). Assessment of NVC requires development of NIRS-EEG joint-imaging sensor montages that are sensitive to the tDCS affected brain areas. In this methods paper, we present a software pipeline incorporating freely available software tools that can be used to target vascular territories with tDCS and develop a NIRS-EEG probe for joint imaging of tDCS-evoked responses. We apply this software pipeline to target primarily the outer convexity of the brain territory (superficial divisions) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). We then present a computational method based on Empirical Mode Decomposition of NIRS and EEG time series into a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and then perform a cross-correlation analysis on those IMFs from NIRS and EEG signals to model NVC at the lesional and contralesional hemispheres of an ischemic stroke patient. For the contralesional hemisphere, a strong positive correlation between IMFs of regional cerebral hemoglobin oxygen saturation and the log-transformed mean-power time-series of IMFs for EEG with a lag of about −15 s was found after a cumulative 550 s stimulation of anodal tDCS. It is postulated that system identification, for example using a continuous-time autoregressive model, of this coupling relation under tDCS perturbation may provide spatiotemporal discriminatory features for the identification of ischemia. Furthermore, portable NIRS-EEG joint imaging can be incorporated into brain computer interfaces to monitor tDCS-facilitated neurointervention as well as cortical reorganization.},

The system operates in near infrared (NIR) range of spectrum and allows functional brain monitoring to be done non-invasively. The detection system employs a photomultiplier and multi-channel scaler to detect and record emerging photons with sub-microsecond resolution (the effective collection time per curve point is {\textasciitilde} 200 ns). Localisation of the visual evoked potentials in the brain was done using knowledge obtained from electroencephalographic (EEG) studies and previous frequency-domain optical NIR spectroscopic systems. The well-known approach of visual stimulation of the human brain, which consists of an alternating black and white checkerboard pattern used previously for the EEG study of neural responses, is applied here. The checkerboard pattern is synchronized with the multi-channel scaler system and allows the analysis of time variation in back-scattered light, at different stimulation frequencies. Slow hemodynamic changes in the human brain due to Hb-HbO$_{\textrm{2}}$ changes in the blood flow were observed, which is evidence of the system's capability to monitor these changes. Monocular visual tests were undertaken and compared with those done with an EEG system. In some subjects a fast optical response on a time scale commensurate with the neural activity associated with the visual cortex was detected. Future work will concentrate on improved experimental protocols and apparatus to confirm the existence of this important physiological signal.},

Exploiting the longer context of raw speech signals seems useful in improving recognition accuracy. However, naive use of longer contexts results in the loss of short-term patterns; thus, recognition accuracy degrades. We propose a multi-timescale feature-extraction architecture of DNNs with blocks of different time scales, which enable capturing long- and short-term patterns of speech signals. Each block consists of complex-valued networks that correspond to Fourier and filterbank transformations for analysis. Experiments showed that the proposed multi-timescale architecture reduced the word error rate by about 3\% compared with those only with the longterm context. Analysis of the extracted features revealed that our architecture efficiently captured the slow and fast changes of speech features.},

	abstract = {The term ‘nexting’ has been used by psychologists to refer to the propensity of people and many other animals to continually predict what will happen next in an immediate, local, and personal sense. The ability to ‘next’ constitutes a basic kind of awareness and knowledge of one’s environment. In this paper we present results with a robot that learns to next in real time, making thousands of predictions about sensory input signals at timescales from 0.1 to 8 seconds. Our predictions are formulated as a generalization of the value functions commonly used in reinforcement learning, where now an arbitrary function of the sensory input signals is used as a pseudo reward, and the discount rate determines the timescale. We show that six thousand predictions, each computed as a function of six thousand features of the state, can be learned and updated online ten times per second on a laptop computer, using the standard temporal-difference(λ) algorithm with linear function approximation. This approach is sufficiently computationally efficient to be used for real-time learning on the robot and sufficiently data efficient to achieve substantial accuracy within 30 minutes. Moreover, a single tile-coded feature representation suffices to accurately predict many different signals over a significant range of timescales. We also extend nexting beyond simple timescales by letting the discount rate be a function of the state and show that nexting predictions of this more general form can also be learned with substantial accuracy. General nexting provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for a robot to acquire predictive knowledge of the dynamics of its environment.},

	doi = {10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489218},
	abstract = {The capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are limited by the operations possible at their individual neurons and synapses. For instance, each neuron's activation only represents a single scalar variable. In addition, because neuronal activations may be dominated by a single timescale in the synaptic input, unsupervised learning from data with multiple timescales has not been generally possible. Here we address these by exploiting the continuous-time and asynchronous operation of spiking neural networks (SNNs), i.e. a biologically-inspired type of ANNs. First, we demonstrate how input neurons can be two-dimensional (2D), i.e. each represent two variables. Second, we show unsupervised learning from multiple timescales simultaneously. 2D neurons operate by allocating each variable to a different timescale in their activation, i.e. one variable corresponds to the timing of individual spikes, and another to the spike rate. We show how these can be modulated separately but simultaneously, and we apply this mixed coding technique to encoding images with two modalities, namely, colour and brightness. Unsupervised multi-timescale learning is achieved by synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity, combined with varying degrees of short-term plasticity. We demonstrate the successful application of this learning scheme on the unsupervised classification of bimodal pictures encoded by our 2D neurons. Taken together, our results show that SNNs are capable of increasing both the information content of each neuron and the exploitable data in the input. We suggest that through these unique features, SNNs may increase the performance and broaden the applicability of ANNs.},

	abstract = {Language models must capture statistical dependencies between words at timescales ranging from very short to very long. Earlier work has demonstrated that dependencies in natural language tend to decay with distance between words according to a power law. However, it is unclear how this knowledge can be used for analyzing or designing neural network language models. In this work, we derived a theory for how the memory gating mechanism in long short-term memory (LSTM) language models can capture power law decay. We found that unit timescales within an LSTM, which are determined by the forget gate bias, should follow an Inverse Gamma distribution. Experiments then showed that LSTM language models trained on natural English text learn to approximate this theoretical distribution. Further, we found that explicitly imposing the theoretical distribution upon the model during training yielded better language model perplexity overall, with particular improvements for predicting low-frequency (rare) words. Moreover, the explicit multi-timescale model selectively routes information about different types of words through units with different timescales, potentially improving model interpretability. These results demonstrate the importance of careful, theoretically-motivated analysis of memory and timescale in language models.},

In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale gated neural network for encoding the temporal dependencies from videos. The developed model stacks multiple gated layers in a recurrent pyramid, which makes it possible to hierarchically model not just pairs but long-term dependencies from video
frames. Additionally, the model combines the Convolutional Neural Networks into its structure that exploits the pictorial nature of the frames and reduces the number of model parameters. Result: We evaluated the proposed model on the datasets of synthetic bouncing-MNIST, standard actions
benchmark of UCF101 and facial expressions benchmark of CK+. The experiment results reveal that on all tasks, the proposed model outperforms the existing approach to build deep stacked gated model and achieves superior performance compared to several recent state-of-the-art techniques. Conclusion:
From the experimental results, we can make the conclusion that our proposed model is able to adapt its structure based on different time scales and can be applied in motion estimation, action recognition and tracking, etc.},

	abstract = {Concurrent electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) bridge brain connectivity across timescales. During concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state recordings, whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) strength is spatially correlated across modalities. However, cross-modal investigations have commonly remained correlational, and joint analysis of EEG-fMRI connectivity is largely unexplored. Here we investigated if there exist (spatially) independent FC networks linked between modalities. We applied the recently proposed hybrid connectivity independent component analysis (connICA) framework to two concurrent EEG-fMRI resting-state datasets (total 40 subjects). Two robust components were found across both datasets. The first component has a uniformly distributed EEG frequency fingerprint linked mainly to intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) in both modalities. Conversely, the second component is sensitive to different EEG frequencies and is primarily linked to intra-ICN connectivity in fMRI but to inter-ICN connectivity in EEG. The first hybrid component suggests that connectivity dynamics within well-known ICNs span timescales, from millisecond range in all canonical frequencies of FCEEG to second range of FCfMRI. Conversely, the second component additionally exposes linked but spatially divergent neuronal processing at the two timescales. This work reveals the existence of joint spatially independent components, suggesting that parts of resting-state connectivity are co-expressed in a linked manner across EEG and fMRI over individuals.Functional connectivity is governed by a whole-brain organization measurable over multiple timescales by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG). The relationship across the whole-brain organization captured at the different timescales of EEG and fMRI is largely unknown. Using concurrent EEG-fMRI, we identified spatially independent components consisting of brain connectivity patterns that co-occur in EEG and fMRI over subjects. We observed a component with similar connectivity organization across EEG and fMRI as well as a component with divergent connectivity. The former component governed all EEG frequencies while the latter was modulated by frequency. These findings show that part of functional connectivity organizes in a common spatial layout over several timescales, while a spatially independent part is modulated by frequency-specific information.},

To discriminate pre-ictal from inter-ictal patterns of EEG signals, a convolutional recurrent neural network with multi-timescale (MT-CRNN) is proposed for seizure prediction. The network model is built to complement the patient-specific seizure prediction approaches. We firstly calculate the correlation coefficients in eight frequency bands from segmented EEG to highlight the key bands among different people. Then CNN is used to extract features and reduce the data dimension, and the output of CNN acts as input of RNN to learn the implicit relationship of the time series. Furthermore, considering that EEG in different time scales reflect neuron activity in distinct scope, we combine three timescale segments of 1 s, 2 s and 3 s. Experiments are done to validate the performance of the proposed model on the dataset of CHB-MIT, and a promising result of 94.8\% accuracy, 91.7\% sensitivity, and 97.7\% specificity are achieved.},

It is of great importance for many real-world applications, such as autonomous driving, which need scene parsing to understand the environment. Recent research has shown that predicting in semantic level is more effective than segmenting the predicted RGB frames. In order to label pixels in future frames correctly, the rich contextual dependencies should be exploit which existing methods paid less attention to. Therefore, we propose a novel network which catches both the short-term and long-term relations of observed frames for future scene parsing. Specifically, we introduce an attention mechanism to model semantic interdependencies between consecutive frames and a modified convolutional LSTM to model the correlations among all the input frames.

	abstract = {Learning new concepts rapidly from a few examples is an open issue in spike-based machine learning. This few-shot learning imposes substantial challenges to the current learning methodologies of spiking neuron networks (SNNs) due to the lack of task-related priori knowledge. The recent learning-to-learn (L2L) approach allows SNNs to acquire priori knowledge through example-level learning and task-level optimization. However, existing L2L-based frameworks do not target the neural dynamics (i.e., neuronal and synaptic parameter changes) on different timescales. This diversity of temporal dynamics is an important attribute in spike-based learning, which facilitates the networks to rapidly acquire knowledge from very few examples and gradually integrate this knowledge. In this work, we consider the neural dynamics on various timescales and provide a multi-timescale optimization (MTSO) framework for SNNs. This framework introduces an adaptive-gated LSTM to accommodate two different timescales of neural dynamics: short-term learning and long-term evolution. Short-term learning is a fast knowledge acquisition process achieved by a novel surrogate gradient online learning (SGOL) algorithm, where the LSTM guides gradient updating of SNN on a short timescale through an adaptive learning rate and weight decay gating. The long-term evolution aims to slowly integrate acquired knowledge and form a priori, which can be achieved by optimizing the LSTM guidance process to tune SNN parameters on a long timescale. Experimental results demonstrate that the collaborative optimization of multi-timescale neural dynamics can make SNNs achieve promising performance for the few-shot learning tasks.},

One such application incorporates cognitive state monitoring into passive BCI (pBCI) systems. Among the challenges facing this development, a significant barrier to adoption is the time-intensive calibration typically needed to tune the system to account for variations in neural activity patterns. An open research question is understanding the relationship between underlying user state and user performance in real-world situations and environments. However, user states are often derived and defined as a function of observed user performance for a particular analysis. Understanding the relationship between user state and user performance ideally requires the definition of user state be independent of observed user performance. This work represents our initial steps towards this goal by using cross-dataset learning, where we define user state from a dataset recorded in a highly-controlled experiment, building a subject-independent pBCI model to predict user state using deep learning approaches, and applying this pBCI model to analyze user performance in a new, unobserved dataset. We show that user performance varies smoothly across a continuum of pBCI model outputs. Our results highlight a promising approach for dealing with one of the major hurdles in the development of BCI systems for healthy users.},

	abstract = {Objective. Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) enable direct communication with a computer, using neural activity as the control signal. This neural signal is generally chosen from a variety of well-studied electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. For a given BCI paradigm, feature extractors and classifiers are tailored to the distinct characteristics of its expected EEG control signal, limiting its application to that specific signal. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which have been used in computer vision and speech recognition to perform automatic feature extraction and classification, have successfully been applied to EEG-based BCIs; however, they have mainly been applied to single BCI paradigms and thus it remains unclear how these architectures generalize to other paradigms. Here, we ask if we can design a single CNN architecture to accurately classify EEG signals from different BCI paradigms, while simultaneously being as compact as possible. Approach. In this work we introduce EEGNet, a compact convolutional neural network for EEG-based BCIs. We introduce the use of depthwise and separable convolutions to construct an EEG-specific model which encapsulates well-known EEG feature extraction concepts for BCI. We compare EEGNet, both for within-subject and cross-subject classification, to current state-of-the-art approaches across four BCI paradigms: P300 visual-evoked potentials, error-related negativity responses (ERN), movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP), and sensory motor rhythms (SMR). Main results. We show that EEGNet generalizes across paradigms better than, and achieves comparably high performance to, the reference algorithms when only limited training data is available across all tested paradigms. In addition, we demonstrate three different approaches to visualize the contents of a trained EEGNet model to enable interpretation of the learned features. Significance. Our results suggest that EEGNet is robust enough to learn a wide variety of interpretable features over a range of BCI tasks. Our models can be found at: https://github.com/vlawhern/arl-eegmodels.},

	abstract = {Many real-world control systems, such as the smart grid and human sensorimotor control systems, have decentralized components that react quickly using local information and centralized components that react slowly using a more global view. This paper seeks to provide a theoretical framework for how to design controllers that are decomposed across timescales in this way. The framework is analogous to how the network utility maximization framework uses optimization decomposition to distribute a global control problem across independent controllers, each of which solves a local problem; except our goal is to decompose a global problem temporally, extracting a timescale separation. Our results highlight that decomposition of a multi-timescale controller into a fast timescale, reactive controller and a slow timescale, predictive controller can be near-optimal in a strong sense. In particular, we exhibit such a design, named Multi-timescale Reflexive Predictive Control (MRPC), which maintains a pertimestep cost within a constant factor of the offline optimal in an adversarial setting.},

Several reinforcement-learning (RL) models were recently proposed to refine the qualitative and quantitative inferences that can be made about these processes based on IGT data. Yet, these models do not account for the complex exploratory patterns which characterize participants’ behavior in the task. Using a dataset of more than 500 subjects, we demonstrate the existence of sequential exploration in the IGT and we describe a new computational architecture disentangling exploitation, random exploration and sequential exploration in this large population of participants. The new Value plus Sequential Exploration (VSE) architecture provided a better fit than previous models. Parameter recovery, model recovery and simulation analyses confirmed the superiority of the VSE scheme. Furthermore, using the VSE model, we confirmed the existence of a significant reduction in directed exploration across lifespan in the IGT, as previously reported with other paradigms. Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily and flexibly fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients and contributing to the development of computational psychiatry.},

	abstract = {This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD), including incidence and prevalence, mortality and morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on caregivers and society. The Special Report discusses the future challenges of meeting care demands for the growing number of people living with Alzheimer's dementia in the United States with a particular emphasis on primary care. By mid-century, the number of Americans age 65 and older with Alzheimer's dementia may grow to 13.8 million. This represents a steep increase from the estimated 5.8 million Americans age 65 and older who have Alzheimer's dementia today. Official death certificates recorded 122,019 deaths from AD in 2018, the latest year for which data are available, making Alzheimer's the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death among Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2018, deaths resulting from stroke, HIV and heart disease decreased, whereas reported deaths from Alzheimer's increased 146.2\%. In 2019, more than 16 million family members and other unpaid caregivers provided an estimated 18.6 billion hours of care to people with Alzheimer's or other dementias. This care is valued at nearly \$244 billion, but its costs extend to family caregivers’ increased risk for emotional distress and negative mental and physical health outcomes. Average per-person Medicare payments for services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other dementias are more than three times as great as payments for beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are more than 23 times as great. Total payments in 2020 for health care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and older with dementia are estimated to be \$305 billion. As the population of Americans living with Alzheimer's dementia increases, the burden of caring for that population also increases. These challenges are exacerbated by a shortage of dementia care specialists, which places an increasing burden on primary care physicians (PCPs) to provide care for people living with dementia. Many PCPs feel underprepared and inadequately trained to handle dementia care responsibilities effectively. This report includes recommendations for maximizing quality care in the face of the shortage of specialists and training challenges in primary care.},

	abstract = {Background: The gambling industry has developed many types of gambling on Internet in recent years. Gambling is a social activity for a majority of the world population, but problem gambling (PG) can emerge. The trajectories of gamblers from initiation to PG development are influenced by many variables, including individual and environmental variables and also variables linked to the gambling characteristics. Marketing has been reported to influence gamblers' perceptions and behaviors, but this is not as clear for digital marketing. Digital gambling marketing is broad, ranging from the marketing of gambling websites to communication and advertising on the social media and networks. The objective of this article was to fill this gap by conducting a systematic literature review in order to answer the following questions: (1) What are the strategies of digital gambling marketing? (2) What is the effect of this exposure on gambling representations, intentions and practices?Method: A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines on Pubmed database (Medline) from February 2020 to March 2020 and Scopus. Existing papers published between January 2000 and February 2020 were identified by searching with this algorithm: (((“internet”[MeSH Major Topic] OR (communications[All Fields] AND media[All Fields])) OR (“social media”[MeSH Terms] OR (“social”[All Fields] AND “media”[All Fields]) OR “social media”[All Fields])) AND “gambling”[MeSH Major Topic]) AND (“marketing”[MeSH Terms] OR “marketing”[All Fields]), in title, keywords or abstract.Results: Ninety-one candidate studies were selected, 21 studies were selected for the systematic review. Sport appeared as a specific target of online gambling marketing. A growing range of platforms for online sport betting and the development of strategies on the social media were identified. Regarding content, a systematic association between sport and gambling was highlighted. Vulnerable populations, such as young people, appeared to be at high risk of exposure to gambling marketing.Conclusion: Little data is available on the strategies of digital gambling marketing or on exposure to it. Sport could be the first target for future research to understand how the industry is targeting specific populations, and what influence these strategies could have on PG development.},

The role of working memory in this complex task has been largely debated in the literature. On one hand, low working memory resources lead to a decrease in the number of advantageous decisions and make a significant part of participants unable to report explicitly which options are the most profitable. On the other hand, several studies have shown no contribution of working memory to the IGT decision patterns. In order to investigate this apparent incompatibility of results, we used an individual differences approach, which has proven an effective method to investigate the role of working memory in cognition. We compared the IGT decision patterns of participants as a function of their working memory capacity (WMC). As expected, contrary to low WMC participants, high WMC participants developed a tendency towards advantageous decisions. These findings lead us to discuss the role of WMC in decision making tasks.},

Functional near-infrared spectroscopy monitors changes in oxy-haemoglobin concentration in the cerebral cortex. It may provide an objective assessment of neurophysiological responses during decision-making processes. Thus, this study investigated the effect of major depressive disorder diagnosis and severity on prefrontal cortex activity during the Iowa gambling task.Methods:Right-handed healthy controls (n?=?25) and patients with major depressive disorder (n?=?25) were matched for age, gender, ethnicity and years of education in this cross-sectional study. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals and the responses made during a computerised Iowa gambling task were recorded. In addition, demographics, clinical history and symptom severity were noted.Results:Compared to healthy controls, patients with major depressive disorder had reduced haemodynamic response in several cortical regions of the frontal lobe (Hedge?s g range from 0.71 to 1.52; p values range from ?0.001 to 0.041). Among patients, mean oxy-haemoglobin declined with major depressive disorder severity in the right orbitofrontal cortex (Pearson?s r?=??0.423; p?=?0.024).Conclusion:Haemodynamic dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex during decision-making processes is associated with major depressive disorder diagnosis and severity. These neurophysiological alterations may have a role in the decision-making capacity of patients with major depressive disorder.},

Following the PRISMA guidelines, we systematically searched for fMRI studies of decision making in older adults using risky decision-making tasks. To perform the quantitative meta-analysis, we used the revised version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) algorithm. A total of 620 references were selected for initial screening. Among these, five studies with a total of 98 cognitively normal older participants (mean age: 69.5 years) were included. The meta-analysis yielded two clusters. Main activations were found in the right insula, bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) and left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). Despite the limited number of studies included, our meta-analysis highlights the crucial involvement of circuits associated with both emotion regulation and the decision to act. However, in contrast to the literature on young adults, our results indicate a different pattern of hemispheric lateralization in older participants. These activations can be used as a minimum pattern of activation in the risky decision-making tasks of healthy older subjects.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          A good-based model proposes that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) represents binary choice outcome, i.e., the chosen good. Previous studies have found that the OFC represents the binary choice outcome in decision-making tasks involving commodity type, cost, risk, and delay. Real-life decisions are often complex and involve uncertainty, rewards, and penalties; however, whether the OFC represents binary choice outcomes in a such decision-making situation, e.g., Iowa gambling task (IGT), remains unclear. Here, we propose that the OFC represents binary choice outcome, i.e., advantageous choice versus disadvantageous choice, in the IGT. We propose two hypotheses: first, the activity pattern in the human OFC represents an advantageous choice; and second, choice induces an OFC-related functional network. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced machine learning tools, we found that the OFC represented an advantageous choice in the IGT. The OFC representation of advantageous choice was related to decision-making performance. Choice modulated the functional connectivity between the OFC and the superior medial gyrus. In conclusion, the OFC represents an advantageous choice during the IGT. In the framework of a good-based model, the results extend the role of the OFC to complex decision-making when making a binary choice.},

	abstract = {Background
Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) assesses decision making in uncertain conditions. Several studies have reported impaired performance on IGT in various clinical population compared to healthy normal. However, some researchers have reported incongruent findings from the basic assumptions of IGT in healthy normal. Our aim was to examine the possible decision making processes on IGT.
Methods
The IGT was administered on two groups: Healthy normal (n = 34) and offspring at high risk for alcoholism (n = 34). Subjects were matched on age (+/–1 year), education (+/–1 year) and gender. Other tools used were: Mini-international Neuropsychiatric Interview, Family Interview for Genetic Studies, Socio-demographic Data Sheet, Annett’s Handedness Questionnaire.
Results
Results showed a significant difference between two groups on selections made from disadvantageous deck A but no significant difference on disadvantageous deck B, advantageous/safe decks C and D. Also, there was no significant difference between two groups on IGT Net score [selections from decks (C + D) – decks (A + B)]. Further analysis showed that varying nature of reward and penalty schedules play an important role in selecting the cards from four decks of IGT. Subjects may prefer infrequent penalty decks without consideration of delayed loss/gain.
Conclusion
Frequency and magnitude of reward/penalty in IGT may adversely impact decision making. Deck B can induce myopia for delayed loss in the healthy normal too because of having a high frequency of gains with high magnitude of reward. Hence, IGT related studies should consider these factors while making an inference about decision making ability.},

When the IGT has been used to examine cases of Internet addiction (IA), the literature reveals inconsistencies in the results. However, few studies have utilized the clinical version of IGT (cIGT) to examine IA cases. The present study aims to resolve previous inconsistencies and to examine the validity of the cIGT by comparing performances of controls with cases of Internet gaming disorder (IGD), a subtype of IA defined by the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.Methods: The study recruited 23 participants with clinically diagnosed IGD and 38 age-matched control participants. Based on the basic assumptions of IGT and the gain–loss frequency viewpoint, a dependent variables analysis was carried out.Results: The results showed no statistical difference between the two groups in most performance indices and therefore support the findings of most IGT-IA studies; in particular, expected value and gain–loss frequency did not distinguish between the IGD cases and controls. However, the participants in both groups were influenced by the gain–loss frequency, revealing the existence of the prominent deck B phenomenon.Conclusion: The findings provide two possible interpretations. The first is that choice behavior deficits do not constitute a characteristic feature of individuals who have been diagnosed with IGD/IA. The second is that, as the cIGT was unable to distinguish the choice behavior of the IGD/IA participants from that of controls, the cIGT may not be relevant for assessing IGD based on the indices provided by the expected value and gain–loss frequency perspectives in the standard administration of IGT.},

	abstract = {The Iowa gambling task (Bechara et al., Cognition 50:7–15, 1994) is designed to simulate a decision making problem under ambiguity, in which the degree of reliance on emotional cues arising from previous experiences contributes to perform advantageously. Recent studies based on the appraisal tendency framework demonstrated that emotional certainty (associated with intuitive strategies) leads to a more advantageous decision pattern, whereas emotional uncertainty (associated with deliberative strategies) impairs the performance in the IGT (Bagneux et al., Motivation and Emotion 37(4):818–827, 2013; Bollon and Bagneux, Cognition and Emotion 27(2):376–384, 2013). Due to the problems in the IGT (Dunn et al., Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews 30:239–271, 2006; Steingroever et al., Psychological Assessment 25(1):180–193, 2013), however, it is an open question to what extent the disadvantageous IGT performance in the uncertainty conditions was based on risky decision making. Addressing the main criticisms on the IGT, the primary aim of the present study is to provide a further explanation for the underlying source of the IGT impairment led by uncertainty appraisals. In line with previous research, we found that participants in the certainty-associated emotion condition (disgust) outperformed those in uncertainty-associated conditions (fear, sadness) in the gambling game. Detailed four-deck format analyses on decision patterns and knowledge levels provided supporting evidence for our main hypothesis that the weak IGT scores in the uncertainty conditions can be summarized as a failure to anticipate the badness and the goodness of the most difficult decks, and a dominant preference for a risky option with high immediate gains and infrequent losses.},

Participants are expected to understand the logic behind the allocation of gains and losses over the course of the test and adapt their pattern of choices accordingly. This review explores the scientific work on studying problem gambling via the IGT while employing neuroimaging techniques. We first concentrate on the historical evolution of the IGT as a mechanism for studying gamblers’ behavioral patterns. Our research will also discuss the prefrontal cortex as this region of the brain is most affected by changes in behavioral patterns. In this review, we describe a number of features that may be useful in investigating decision-making patterns that lead to gambling addiction. We discuss the evidence base to date including experiments involving gambling behavior in different groups of participants (e.g., males and females, adults and minors, patients and controls) and alterations to experiment conditions that provide more thorough understanding of thought patterns in potential gamblers. We conclude that psychological testing combined with functional imaging provide powerful tools to further examine the relationships between functional impairment of the brain and a person’s ability to objectively anticipate the end results of their decisions.},

Several reinforcement-learning (RL) models were recently proposed to refine the qualitative and quantitative inferences that can be made about these processes based on IGT data. Yet, these models do not account for the complex exploratory patterns which characterize participants’ behavior in the task. Using a dataset of more than 500 subjects, we demonstrate the existence of sequential exploration in the IGT and we describe a new computational architecture disentangling exploitation, random exploration and sequential exploration in this large population of participants. The new Value plus Sequential Exploration (VSE) architecture provided a better fit than previous models. Parameter recovery, model recovery and simulation analyses confirmed the superiority of the VSE scheme. Furthermore, using the VSE model, we confirmed the existence of a significant reduction in directed exploration across lifespan in the IGT, as previously reported with other paradigms. Finally, we provide a user-friendly toolbox enabling researchers to easily and flexibly fit computational models on the IGT data, hence promoting reanalysis of the numerous datasets acquired in various populations of patients and contributing to the development of computational psychiatry.},

In the present study, 59 healthy men and women were randomized into either a three-week online training program targeted to improve emotional intelligence (n = 29), or a placebo control training program targeted to improve awareness of nonemotional aspects of the environment (n = 30). Compared to placebo, participants in the emotional intelligence training group showed increased performance on the total emotional intelligence score of the Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test, a performance measure of emotional intelligence, as well as subscales of perceiving emotions and facilitating thought. Moreover, after emotional intelligence training, but not after placebo training, individuals displayed the ability to arrive at optimal performance faster (i.e., they showed a faster learning rate) during an emotion-guided decision-making task (i.e., the Iowa Gambling Task). More specifically, although both groups showed similar performance at the start of the Iowa Gambling Task from pre- to posttraining, the participants in the emotional intelligence training group learned to choose more advantageous than disadvantageous decks than those in the placebo training group by the time they reached the “hunch” period of the task (i.e., the point in the task when implicit task learning is thought to have occurred). Greater total improvements in performance on the Iowa Gambling Task from pre- to posttraining in the emotional intelligence training group were also positively correlated with pre- to posttraining changes in Mayer–Salovey–Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test scores, in particular with changes in the ability to perceive emotions. The present study provides preliminary evidence that emotional intelligence can be trained with the help of an online training program targeted at adults; it also suggests that changes in emotional intelligence, as a result of such a program, can lead to improved emotion-guided decision-making.},

	abstract = {Many researchers have used the standard Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) to assess decision-making in adolescence given increased risk-taking during this developmental period. Most studies are cross-sectional and do not observe behavioral trajectories over time, limiting interpretation. This longitudinal study investigated healthy adolescents’ and young adults’ IGT performance across a 10-year span. A total of 189 individuals (aged 9–23 at baseline) completed a baseline session and were followed at 2-year intervals yielding 5 time-points. IGT deck contingencies were shuffled over time to reduce practice effects. IGT performance (good minus bad decisions) was measured at each assessment point and separated into 3 metrics: overall performance (all blocks), decision-making under ambiguity (blocks 1 and 2), and decision-making under risk (blocks 3, 4, and 5). Covariates included estimated intelligence and affective dispositions as measured by the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation System (BIS/BAS) Scales. A linear effect of age yielded the best fit when comparing linear and quadratic effects of age on overall IGT performance. Age and intelligence positively predicted overall performance, whereas affective approach tendencies (BAS) negatively predicted overall performance. Practice effects were observed and controlled for. Models of ambiguity and risk metrics yielded different patterns of significant predictors. Age predicted better performance and affective approach tendencies predicted worse performance for both metrics. Intelligence was a significant predictor for risk, but not ambiguity. This longitudinal study extends prior work by showing age-related improvements in reward-based decision-making and associating those improvements with cognitive and affective variables. Implications of the results for adolescent development are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)},

However, the complexity of the IGT makes it difficult to attribute variation in performance to specific cognitive processes. Several cognitive models have been proposed for the IGT in an effort to address this problem, but currently no single model shows optimal performance for both short- and long-term prediction accuracy and parameter recovery. Here, we propose the Outcome-Representation Learning (ORL) model, a novel model that provides the best compromise between competing models. We test the performance of the ORL model on 393 subjects' data collected across multiple research sites, and we show that the ORL reveals distinct patterns of decision-making in substance-using populations. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple model comparison metrics to make valid inference with cognitive models and sheds light on learning mechanisms that play a role in underweighting of rare events.},

	abstract = {Background and aims Online social networking sites (SNSs) like Facebook provide users with myriad social rewards. These social rewards bring users back to SNSs repeatedly, with some users displaying maladaptive, excessive SNS use. Symptoms of this excessive SNS use are similar to symptoms of substance use and behavioral addictive disorders. Importantly, individuals with substance use and behavioral addictive disorders have difficulty making value-based decisions, as demonstrated with paradigms like the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT); however, it is currently unknown if excessive SNS users display the same decision-making deficits. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between excessive SNS use and IGT performance. Methods We administered the Bergen Facebook Addiction Scale (BFAS) to 71 participants to assess their maladaptive use of the Facebook SNS. We next had them perform 100 trials of the IGT to assess their value-based decision making. Results We found a negative correlation between BFAS score and performance in the IGT across participants, specifically over the last block of 20 trials. There were no correlations between BFAS score and IGT performance in earlier blocks of trials. Discussion Our results demonstrate that more severe, excessive SNS use is associated with more deficient value-based decision making. In particular, our results indicate that excessive SNS users may make more risky decisions during the IGT task. Conclusion This result further supports a parallel between individuals with problematic, excessive SNS use, and individuals with substance use and behavioral addictive disorders.},

Here, we tested the hypothesis that dopamine release would be associated with increased excitement levels in Pathological Gamblers compared with Healthy Controls. Design Pathological Gamblers and Healthy Controls were experimentally compared in a non-gambling (baseline) and gambling condition. Measurements We used Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with the tracer raclopride to measure dopamine D 2/3 receptor availability in the ventral striatum during a non-gambling and gambling condition of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). After each condition participants rated their excitement level. Setting Laboratory experiment. Participants 18 Pathological Gamblers and 16 Healthy Controls. Findings Pathological Gamblers with dopamine release in the ventral striatum had significantly higher excitement levels than Healthy Controls despite lower IGT performance. No differences in excitement levels and IGT performance were found between Pathological Gamblers and Healthy Controls without dopamine release. Pathological Gamblers showed a significant correlation between dopamine release and excitement level, while no such interaction was found in Healthy Controls. Conclusions In pathological gamblers dopamine release in the ventral striatum appears to be associated with increased excitement levels despite lower IGT performance. The results might suggest a ‘double deficit’ function of dopamine in pathological gambling, where dopamine release reinforces maladaptive gambling through increasing excitement levels, reducing inhibition of risky decisions, or a combination of both. These findings may have implications for the understanding of dopamine in pathological gambling and other forms of addiction.},

Bechara et al. have used this result to support their view that nonconscious somatic markers can guide advantageous behavior. By using more sensitive methods, we show that participants have much more knowledge about the game than previously thought. In fact, participants report knowledge of the advantageous strategy more reliably than they behave advantageously. Furthermore, when they behave advantageously, their verbal reports nearly always reveal evidence of quantitative knowledge about the outcomes of the decks that would be sufficient to guide such advantageous behavior. In addition, there is evidence that participants also have access to more qualitative reportable knowledge. These results are compatible with the view that, in this task, both overt behavior and verbal reports reflect sampling from consciously accessible knowledge; there is no need to appeal to nonconscious somatic markers. We also discuss the findings of other studies that similarly suggest alternative interpretations of other evidence previously used to support a role for somatic markers in decision-making.},

	abstract = {The Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) involves probabilistic learning via monetary rewards and punishments, where advantageous task performance requires subjects to forego potential large immediate rewards for small longer-term rewards to avoid larger losses. Pathological gamblers (PG) perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistent preference toward high, immediate, and uncertain rewards despite experiencing larger losses. In this contribution, we review studies that investigated processes associated with poor IGT performance in PG. Findings from these studies seem to fit with recent neurocognitive models of addiction, which argue that the diminished ability of addicted individuals to ponder short-term against long-term consequences of a choice may be the product of an hyperactive automatic attentional and memory system for signaling the presence of addiction-related cues (e.g., high uncertain rewards associated with disadvantageous decks selection during the IGT) and for attributing to such cues pleasure and excitement. This incentive-salience associated with gambling-related choice in PG may be so high that it could literally “hijack” resources [“hot” executive functions (EFs)] involved in emotional self-regulation and necessary to allow the enactment of further elaborate decontextualized problem-solving abilities (“cool” EFs). A framework for future research is also proposed, which highlights the need for studies examining how these processes contribute specifically to the aberrant choice profile displayed by PG on the IGT.},

Results showed that both negative affect and BAS were related to riskier performance on the IGT; BAS Fun Seeking was still related to IGT even after controlling for negative affect. Cluster analytic group analyses showed that individuals highest in BAS Fun Seeking performed worst on IGT, relative to individuals low on BAS scales and individuals high on only BAS Drive and Reward. Although both negative affect and Fun Seeking were related to IGT performance, there was no interaction between mood and personality. Results suggest that both state mood (particularly negative affect) and personality (particularly Fun Seeking) are independently related to risky performance on IGT. Results suggest a need to assess both affect and personality dimensions when attempting to explain poor IGT performance, particularly in clinical populations.},

Very few studies have employed the IGT in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) investigations, in part, because the task is cognitively complex. Here we report a method for exploring brain activity using fMRI during performance of the IGT. Decision-making during the IGT was associated with activity in several brain regions in a group of healthy individuals. The activated regions were consistent with the neural circuitry hypothesized to underlie somatic marker activation and decision-making. Specifically, a neural circuitry involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (for working memory), the insula and posterior cingulate cortex (for representations of emotional states), the mesial orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (for coupling the two previous processes), the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate/SMA (supplementary motor area) for implementing behavioral decisions was engaged. These results have implications for using the IGT to study abnormal mechanisms of decision making in a variety of clinical populations. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

This approach has been used to develop a test package for Alzheimer's disease that consists of some simple cognitive tests (Paired Associate Learning Test, Trailmaking Test, and Raven's Progressive Matrices) combined with age and family history of dementia. A total of 1,454 subjects who had been recruited into the Medical Research Council Elderly Hypertension Trial between 1983 and 1985 completed cognitive tests at entry to the trial (when they were without signs of dementia) and 1 month later. Their dementia status was ascertained in 1990–1991. The test package identified 52\% of Alzheimer's disease cases with a 9\% false-positive rate or 90\% of Alzheimer's disease cases with a 29\% false-positive rate. The author proposes the use of a similar test package in conjunction with a test for apolipoprotein E e4 status, which is a powerful risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease, as a likelihood ratio approach to the prospective identification of Alzheimer's disease cases. This approach could be followed by ethically sound trials of new therapeutic agents for subjects who have a high probability of developing Alzheimer's disease.},

To this end, they use hierarchical Bayesian models with change points, for which posterior distributions are calculated using the Gibbs sampler. They make comparisons between several such models using both prior and posterior Bayes factors, and compare the results from the models suggested by these two model selection criteria.},

	abstract = {Most of methods in neuroimaging studies are usually based on voxel-wise statistical tests which are performed on functional or structural magnetic resonance (MR) images across or within subjects. Such methods ( i.e. t-test and paired t-test ) are univariate in nature and can only describe the linear association between the brain structure/function and other variables of interest. In this study, we propose a Bayesian network approach combining the data among MR images and clinical/cognitive function variables to assist the early prevention strategy and diagnose the mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The Bayesian network is a powerful knowledge representation and reasoning tool under conditions of uncertainty. Our application of such procedure describes nonlinear multivariate relationships between the human brain structures, function variables and other measurements of interest. Cross-validation approach was utilized in our study for the construction and evaluation of the proposed Bayesian network model. Twenty-five MCI subjects were selected from whom we acquired structural MR data. These MR images were then segmentated and registered to the MNI template and with automated structure volume calculated and made discrete. These volumes included hippocampus, thalamus and perirhinal, etc. With these imaging data and other clinical measurements, we used heuristic search method to construct our Bayesian model and evaluated its reliability using a scoring method. This construction procedure included the training of the structure and estimation of the parameters of the Bayesian network using MR data from 15 these subjects included in this study. To evaluate the use of the proposed model, inference was made with the masked variables using the MR data from the remaining subjects. It was found that MCI was mainly dependent on hippocampus, thalamus and entorhinal. Our method could be used to early diagnose the presence of the mild cognitive impairment from structural MR images and behavioral data.},

A complex adaptive systems approach, (e.g. GA-SVM-oracle hybrid) can sift through the combinatorics of feature subset selection, yielding a modest set of only the most influential features. Then using known likelihoods of demographics associated to dementia, and assuming direct and independent influence of dementia upon speech features, the BN is specified. The conditional probabilities needed can be estimated with far fewer data than the traditional BN data-driven approach. Although BNs have advantages (intuitive interpretation and graceful handling of missing data) they also have challenges. We report initial implementation results that suggest the need to reduce continuous variables to discrete categories, and the still-remaining need to estimate a substantial number of conditional probabilities, remain challenges for BNs. We suggest some ways forward in the application of BNs with the objective of improving / refining Alzheimer's / dementia detection using speech.},

	abstract = {A number of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies reported the existence of default mode network (DMN) and its disruption due to the presence of a disease such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this investigation, first, we used the independent component analysis (ICA) technique to confirm the DMN difference between patients with AD and normal control (NC) reported in previous studies. Consistent with the previous studies, the decreased resting-state functional connectivity of DMN in AD was identified in posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), inferior parietal cortex (IPC), inferior temporal cortex (ITC), and hippocampus (HC). Moreover, we introduced Bayesian network (BN) to study the effective connectivity of DMN and the difference between AD and NC. When compared the DMN effective connectivity in AD with the one in NC using a nonparametric random permutation test, we found that connections from left HC to left IPC, left ITC to right HC, right HC to left IPC, to MPFC and to PCC were all lost. In addition, in AD group, the connection directions between right HC and left HC, between left HC and left ITC, and between right IPC and right ITC were opposite to those in NC group. The connections of right HC to other regions, except left HC, within the BN were all statistically in-distinguishable from 0, suggesting an increased right hippocampal pathological and functional burden in AD. The altered effective connectivity in patients with AD may reveal more characteristics of the disease and may serve as a potential biomarker. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Predicting the progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) has been held back for decades due to the lack of sufficient longitudinal data required for the development of novel machine learning algorithms. This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm for predicting the progression of Alzheimer’s disease using a distributed multimodal, multitask learning method. More specifically, each individual task is defined as a regression model, which predicts cognitive scores at a single time point. Since the prediction tasks for multiple intervals are related to each other in chronological order, multitask regression models have been developed to track the relationship between subsequent tasks. Furthermore, since subjects have various combinations of recording modalities together with other genetic, neuropsychological and demographic risk factors, special attention is given to the fact that each modality may experience a specific sparsity pattern. The model is hence generalized by exploiting multiple individual multitask regression coefficient matrices for each modality. The outcome for each independent modality-specific learner is then integrated with complementary information, known as risk factor parameters, revealing the most prevalent trends of the multimodal data. This new feature space is then used as input to the gradient boosting kernel in search for a more accurate prediction. This proposed model not only captures the complex relationships between the different feature representations, but it also ignores any unrelated information which might skew the regression coefficients. Comparative assessments are made between the performance of the proposed method with several other well-established methods using different multimodal platforms. The results indicate that by capturing the interrelatedness between the different modalities and extracting only relevant information in the data, even in an incomplete longitudinal dataset, will yield minimized prediction errors.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0\% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9\% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5\% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2\% and an AUC of 77.5\% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods.},

	abstract = {We propose a novel integrated framework that jointly models complementary information from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography to extract biomarkers of brain connectivity predictive of behavior. Our framework couples a generative model of the connectomics data with a deep network that predicts behavioral scores. The generative component is a structurally-regularized Dynamic Dictionary Learning (sr-DDL) model that decomposes the dynamic rs-fMRI correlation matrices into a collection of shared basis networks and time varying subject-specific loadings. We use the DTI tractography to regularize this matrix factorization and learn anatomically informed functional connectivity profiles. The deep component of our framework is an LSTM-ANN block, which uses the temporal evolution of the subject-specific sr-DDL loadings to predict multidimensional clinical characterizations. Our joint optimization strategy collectively estimates the basis networks, the subject-specific time-varying loadings, and the neural network weights. We validate our framework on a dataset of neurotypical individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) database to map to cognition and on a separate multi-score prediction task on individuals diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in a five-fold cross validation setting. Our hybrid model outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches at clinical outcome prediction and learns interpretable multimodal neural signatures of brain organization.},

	abstract = {Brain age is becoming a widely applied imaging-based biomarker of neural aging and potential proxy for brain integrity and health. We estimated multimodal and modality-specific brain age in the Whitehall II (WHII) MRI cohort using machine learning and imaging-derived measures of gray matter (GM) morphology, white matter microstructure (WM), and resting state functional connectivity (FC). The results showed that the prediction accuracy improved when multiple imaging modalities were included in the model (R2 = 0.30, 95\% CI [0.24, 0.36]). The modality-specific GM and WM models showed similar performance (R2 = 0.22 [0.16, 0.27] and R2 = 0.24 [0.18, 0.30], respectively), while the FC model showed the lowest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.002 [-0.005, 0.008]), indicating that the FC features were less related to chronological age compared to structural measures. Follow-up analyses showed that FC predictions were similarly low in a matched sub-sample from UK Biobank, and although FC predictions were consistently lower than GM predictions, the accuracy improved with increasing sample size and age range. Cardiovascular risk factors, including high blood pressure, alcohol intake, and stroke risk score, were each associated with brain aging in the WHII cohort. Blood pressure showed a stronger association with white matter compared to gray matter, while no differences in the associations of alcohol intake and stroke risk with these modalities were observed. In conclusion, machine-learning based brain age prediction can reduce the dimensionality of neuroimaging data to provide meaningful biomarkers of individual brain aging. However, model performance depends on study-specific characteristics including sample size and age range, which may cause discrepancies in findings across studies.},

	abstract = {This paper asks whether integrating multimodal EEG and fMRI data offers a better characterisation of functional brain architectures than either modality alone. This evaluation rests upon a dynamic causal model that generates both EEG and fMRI data from the same neuronal dynamics. We introduce the use of Bayesian fusion to provide informative (empirical) neuronal priors – derived from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of EEG data – for subsequent DCM of fMRI data. To illustrate this procedure, we generated synthetic EEG and fMRI timeseries for a mismatch negativity (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using biologically plausible model parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a DCM of empirical, open access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that Bayesian fusion provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or model evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in relation to inverting fMRI data alone. We quantified the benefits of multimodal fusion with the information gain pertaining to neuronal and haemodynamic parameters – as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their prior and posterior densities. Remarkably, this analysis suggested that EEG data can improve estimates of haemodynamic parameters; thereby furnishing proof-of-principle that Bayesian fusion of EEG and fMRI is necessary to resolve conditional dependencies between neuronal and haemodynamic estimators. These results suggest that Bayesian fusion may offer a useful approach that exploits the complementary temporal (EEG) and spatial (fMRI) precision of different data modalities. We envisage the procedure could be applied to any multimodal dataset that can be explained by a DCM with a common neuronal parameterisation.},

This neural profiling approach offers a customizable tool for inspecting and comparing brand-specific mental associations, both across brands and across consumers.

Military operations and rescue activities in the aftermath of recent earthquakes and bombings indicate a tremendous need for greater access to denied areas within any crisis site involving collapsed structures. Recent developments in the remote inspection industry show great potential for employment of small robotic micro-rover systems in expanded roles for Urban Search and Rescue. This paper discusses key issues in the application of robotic systems to Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) activities and discusses ongoing development of a knowledge-based system for efficient management of automated search assets. USAR modeling and “micro-bot” employment advantages are addressed first, followed by a discussion of numerical method shortcomings in the context of search asset allocation. KNOBSAR is then proposed as an initial expert system prototype designed to interact with various structural collapse simulation packages and provide advice on search asset allocation to specific entry points within a crisis site. KNOBSAR structure and design is then illustrated in terms of micro-bot allocation scenarios to various collapsed structure entry points. The conclusion drawn from literature review, experimentation and personal experience is that AI technologies in the form of robotic platforms and decision support tools can have a tremendous impact on overall search efficiency for the USAR community, and represent an important field of study for related military applications.},

Minecraft is an ideal foundation for such a platform, as it exposes agents to complex 3D worlds, coupled with infinitely varied game-play. Project Malmo provides a sophisticated abstraction layer on top of Minecraft that supports a wide range of experimentation scenarios, ranging from navigation and survival to collaboration and problem solving tasks. In this demo we present the Malmo platform and its capabilities. The platform is publicly released as open source software at IJCAI, to support openness and collaboration in AI research.},

	abstract = {With the proliferation of unmanned air vehicles in the last few decades, there has been a series of applications proposed around the concept of collaborative unmanned systems. However, it is difficult to assess at what point collaboration actually results in true benefits to mission performance and also difficult to determine the degree of benefit possible to achieve. This paper describes a framework which allows decision makers to analyze the effectiveness of a coordinated group of UAVs as a function of the physical mission parameters, showing benefit over a single UAV or uncoordinated multiaircraft approach. To demonstrate the use of the framework, a case study is presented for a maritime search and rescue mission on a parameterized mission space. From the analysis, critical points in the mission space were found where the coordinated group of UAVs brought no additional benefits to the mission. However, at other points they were able to cut down the mission time by more than one hour. This framework can be used to guide decision makers and help estimate the effectiveness of coordinated UAVs in a parameterized mission space.},

The framework is domain-independent and can be applied to both defense and civilian adaptive HMT. The paper concludes with recommendations for advancing the state-of-the-art in HMT.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a new architecture of deep neural networks (DNNs) for acoustic models. Training DNNs from raw speech signals will provide 1) novel features of signals, 2) normalization-free processing such as utterance-wise mean subtraction, and 3) low-latency speech recognition for robot audition. Exploiting the longer context of raw speech signals seems useful in improving recognition accuracy. However, naive use of longer contexts results in the loss of short-term patterns; thus, recognition accuracy degrades. We propose a multi-timescale feature-extraction architecture of DNNs with blocks of different time scales, which enable capturing long- and short-term patterns of speech signals. Each block consists of complex-valued networks that correspond to Fourier and filterbank transformations for analysis. Experiments showed that the proposed multi-timescale architecture reduced the word error rate by about 3\% compared with those only with the longterm context. Analysis of the extracted features revealed that our architecture efficiently captured the slow and fast changes of speech features.},

	abstract = {Information is transmitted in the brain through various kinds of neurons that respond differently to the same signal. Full characteristics including cognitive functions of the brain should ultimately be comprehended by building simulators capable of precisely mirroring spike responses of a variety of neurons. Neuronal modeling that had remained on a qualitative level has recently advanced to a quantitative level, but is still incapable of accurately predicting biological data and requires high computational cost. In this study, we devised a simple, fast computational model that can be tailored to any cortical neuron not only for reproducing but also for predicting a variety of spike responses to greatly fluctuating currents. The key features of this model are a multi-time scale adaptive threshold predictor and a nonresetting leaky integrator. This model is capable of reproducing a rich variety of neuronal spike responses, including regular spiking, intrinsic bursting, fast spiking, and chattering, by adjusting only three adaptive threshold parameters. This model can express a continuous variety of the firing characteristics in a three-dimensional parameter space rather than just those identified in the conventional discrete categorization. Both high flexibility and low computational cost would help to model the real brain function faithfully and examine how network properties may be influenced by the distributed characteristics of component neurons.

	abstract = {The term ‘nexting’ has been used by psychologists to refer to the propensity of people and many other animals to continually predict what will happen next in an immediate, local, and personal sense. The ability to ‘next’ constitutes a basic kind of awareness and knowledge of one’s environment. In this paper we present results with a robot that learns to next in real time, making thousands of predictions about sensory input signals at timescales from 0.1 to 8 seconds. Our predictions are formulated as a generalization of the value functions commonly used in reinforcement learning, where now an arbitrary function of the sensory input signals is used as a pseudo reward, and the discount rate determines the timescale. We show that six thousand predictions, each computed as a function of six thousand features of the state, can be learned and updated online ten times per second on a laptop computer, using the standard temporal-difference(λ) algorithm with linear function approximation. This approach is sufficiently computationally efficient to be used for real-time learning on the robot and sufficiently data efficient to achieve substantial accuracy within 30 minutes. Moreover, a single tile-coded feature representation suffices to accurately predict many different signals over a significant range of timescales. We also extend nexting beyond simple timescales by letting the discount rate be a function of the state and show that nexting predictions of this more general form can also be learned with substantial accuracy. General nexting provides a simple yet powerful mechanism for a robot to acquire predictive knowledge of the dynamics of its environment.},

	abstract = {Algorithms are specifications of action sequences, similar to recipes for cooking. The description should be concrete enough to cook a tasteful meal. On the other hand, some abstraction is necessary to keep the presentation readable; no one teaches the cook how to dice onions. In presenting algorithms in computer science, the situation is similar. The presentation should be concrete enough to allow analysis and reimplementation, but abstract enough to be ported on different programming languages and machines. The process of problem solving can often be modeled as a search in a state space starting from some given initial state with rules describing how to transform one state into another. They have to be applied over and over again to eventually satisfy some goal condition. In many areas of computer science, heuristics are viewed as practical rules of thumb. In artificial intelligence search, however, heuristics are well-defined mappings of states to numbers. There are different types of search heuristics. This chapter introduces notational background, specific puzzles, and general problem formalisms. It recalls the success story of heuristic search and studies heuristics as efficiently computable lower bounds.},

The U.S. Coast Guards computerized search planning aids have not kept up with advances in these areas or with technology in general. This report reviews the history and recent advances of search theory and its application to a variety of search problems. It then reviews the history of the U.S. Coast Guards search planning methods, showing where search theory was initially applied, albeit in a necessarily very limited way, and where later modifications departed from the theoretical basis of the original methodology. Several computerized search planning decision support tools are analyzed and compared, as are the differences between an analytic approach and a simulation approach. The results are summarized in a matrix. The U.S. Coast Guard needs a new search planning decision support tool for search and rescue and other missions. This tool should use the simulation approach due to its power and flexibility as compared to analytic techniques.},

A mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulation is proposed to optimally solve the multi-agent discrete search and rescue (SAR) path planning problem, maximizing cumulative probability of success in detecting a target. It extends a single agent decision model to a multi-agent setting capturing anticipated feedback information resulting from possible observation outcomes during projected path execution while expanding possible agent actions to all possible neighboring move directions, considerably augmenting computational complexity. A network representation is further exploited to alleviate problem modeling, constraint specification, and speed-up computation. The proposed MIP approach uses CPLEX problem-solving technology in promptly providing near-optimal solutions for realistic problems, while offering a robust upper bound derived from Lagrangean integrality constraint relaxation. Modeling extension to a closed-loop environment to incorporate real-time action outcomes over a receding time horizon can even be envisioned given acceptable run-time performance. A generalized parameter-driven objective function is then proposed and discussed to suitably define a variety of user-defined objectives. Computational results reporting the performance of the approach clearly show its value.},

Nucleus accumbens activation preceded risky choices as well as risk-seeking mistakes, while anterior insula activation preceded riskless choices as well as risk-aversion mistakes. These findings suggest that distinct neural circuits linked to anticipatory affect promote different types of financial choices and indicate that excessive activation of these circuits may lead to investing mistakes.

	abstract = {In functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) research, nucleus accumbens (NAcc) activation spontaneously increases prior to financial risk taking. Since anticipation of diverse rewards can increase NAcc activation, even incidental reward cues may influence financial risk-taking. Using event-related FMRI, we predicted and found that anticipation of viewing rewarding stimuli (erotic pictures for 15 heterosexual males) increased financial risk taking, and that this effect was partially mediated by increases in NAcc activation. These results are consistent with the notion that incidental reward cues influence financial risk taking by altering anticipatory affect, and so identify a neuropsychological mechanism that may underlie effective emotional appeals in financial, marketing, and political domains.},

	abstract = {Approach-avoidance conflict arises when the drives to pursue reward and avoid harm are incompatible. Previous neuroimaging studies of approach-avoidance conflict have shown large variability in reported neuroanatomical correlates. These prior studies have generally neglected to account for potential sources of variability, such as individual differences in choice preferences and modeling of hemodynamic response during conflict. In the present study, we controlled for these limitations using a hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM). This enabled us to measure participant-specific per-trial estimates of conflict during an approach-avoidance task. We also employed a variable epoch method to identify brain structures specifically sensitive to conflict. In a sample of 28 human participants, we found that only a limited set of brain structures [inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and right pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA)] are specifically correlated with approach-avoidance conflict. These findings suggest that controlling for previous sources of variability increases the specificity of the neuroanatomical correlates of approach-avoidance conflict.},

	abstract = {Several public health departments throughout North America have responded to the obesity epidemic by mandating that restaurants publish calories at the point of purchase—with the intention of encouraging healthier food decisions. To help determine whether accompanying calorie information successfully changes a food’s appetitive value, this study investigated the influence of calorie information on brain responses to food images. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning, dieting (N = 22) and non-dieting (N = 20) participants viewed pictures of food with and without calorie information and rated their desire to eat the food. When food images were paired with calorie information, not only did self-reported desire to eat the food decrease, but reward system activation (Neurosynth-defined from the term “food”) decreased and control system activation (the fronto-parietal [FP] control system) increased. Additionally, a parametric modulation of reward activation by food preferences was attenuated in the context of calorie information. Finally, whole brain multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) revealed patterns of activation in a region of the reward system—the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)—that were more similar for food images presented with and without calorie information in dieting than non-dieting participants, suggesting that dieters may spontaneously consider calorie information when viewing food. Taken together, these results suggest that calorie information may alter brain responses to food cues by simultaneously reducing reward system activation and increasing control system activation. Moreover, individuals with greater experience or stronger motivations to consider calorie information (i.e., dieters) may more naturally do so, as evidenced by a greater degree of representational similarity between food images with and without calorie information. Combining an awareness of calories with the motivation to control them may more effectively elicit diet-related behavior change.},

Our study is the first to investigate such counteractive control processes in the brain employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a sample of successful self-regulators. Indeed, besides the traditional finding that foods elicit heightened attention as witnessed by greater activation of primary visual cortex, we found that viewing palatable foods elicited brain activation in areas associated with self-regulation. Crucially, brain activation in self-regulation areas was related to diet importance. Thus, our results are the first to show that food cues not only evoke hedonic brain responses; in successful self-regulators they also trigger alarm bell responses, which may reflect the neural processes underlying successful self-control.},

	abstract = {Functional imaging studies examining the neural correlates of risk have mainly relied on paradigms involving exposure to simple chance gambles and an economic definition of risk as variance in the probability distribution over possible outcomes. However, there is little evidence that choices made during gambling tasks predict naturalistic risk-taking behaviors such as drug use, extreme sports, or even equity investing. To better understand the neural basis of naturalistic risk-taking, we scanned participants using fMRI while they completed the Balloon Analog Risk Task (BART), an experimental measure that includes an active decision/choice component and that has been found to correlate with a number of naturalistic risk taking behaviors. In the task, as in many naturalistic settings, escalating risk-taking occurs under uncertainty and might be experienced either as the accumulation of greater potential rewards, or as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value). We found that areas previously linked to risk and risk-taking (bilateral anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)) were activated as participants continued to inflate balloons. Interestingly, we found that ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) activity decreased as participants further expanded balloons. In light of previous findings implicating the vmPFC in value calculation, this result suggests that escalating risk-taking in the task might be perceived as exposure to increasing possible losses (and decreasing expected value) rather than the increasing potential total reward relative to the starting point of the trial. A better understanding of how neural activity changes with risk-taking behavior in the task offers insight into the potential neural mechanisms driving naturalistic risk-taking.},

Second, we showed that increased hunger, which is associated with lower self-control, reduced the magnitude effect. Third, we tested an intervention designed to increase self-control and showed that it reduced the magnitude effect.

Modeling subjective valuation indicated that participants distinguished between themselves and others with dissimilar preferences. Activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was consistently modulated by relative subjective value. Multi-voxel pattern analysis indicated that activity in the dmPFC uniquely encoded relative subjective value and generalized across self and other and across both tasks. Furthermore, agent cross-decoding accuracy between self and other in the dmPFC was related to self-reported social attitudes. These findings indicate that the dmPFC emerges as a medial prefrontal node that utilizes a task-invariant mechanism for computing relative subjective value for self and other.},

Participants are expected to understand the logic behind the allocation of gains and losses over the course of the test and adapt their pattern of choices accordingly. This review explores the scientific work on studying problem gambling via the IGT while employing neuroimaging techniques. We first concentrate on the historical evolution of the IGT as a mechanism for studying gamblers’ behavioral patterns. Our research will also discuss the prefrontal cortex as this region of the brain is most affected by changes in behavioral patterns. In this review, we describe a number of features that may be useful in investigating decision-making patterns that lead to gambling addiction. We discuss the evidence base to date including experiments involving gambling behavior in different groups of participants (e.g., males and females, adults and minors, patients and controls) and alterations to experiment conditions that provide more thorough understanding of thought patterns in potential gamblers. We conclude that psychological testing combined with functional imaging provide powerful tools to further examine the relationships between functional impairment of the brain and a person’s ability to objectively anticipate the end results of their decisions.},

Pathological gambling (PG) subjects perform worse on the IGT compared to controls, relating to their persistence at high risk decisions involving the continued choice of potential large immediate rewards despite experiencing larger punishments. We wished to determine if neural processing of risk and reward within striatal and frontal cortex is associated with this behaviour observed in PG. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to assess brain activity in response to a computerized version of the IGT. Thirteen male PG subjects with no active comorbidities were compared to 13 demographically matched control subjects. In agreement with previous behavioural studies, PG subjects performed worse on the IGT and made more high-risk choices compared to controls, particularly after experiencing wins and losses. During high-risk gambling decisions, fMRI demonstrated that PG subjects exhibited relatively increased frontal lobe and basal ganglia activation, particularly involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), caudate and amygdala. Increased activation of regions encompassing the extended reward pathway in PG subjects during high risk choices suggests that the persistence of PG may be due to the increased salience of immediate and greater potential monetary rewards relative to lower monetary rewards or potential future losses. Whether this over activation of the reward pathway is associated with the development of PG warrants further investigation.},

The prefrontal cortices are particularly vulnerable to age-related decline, and numerous studies implicate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) in successful IGT performance. However, the relationship between IGT performance and VMPFC function in older adults has not yet been tested by fMRI. In the present study, older adults with seemingly no cognitive impairments performed the IGT and a non-gambling control task during fMRI. Group analyses indicate that in these older adults, regardless of IGT performance level, a right VMPFC subregion is activated during the IGT, while successful IGT performance is correlated with left VMPFC activation, suggesting that bilateral VMPFC during risky, nontransparent situations may contribute to successful decision-making in older adults. Individual subject analyses reveal substantial variation regarding the extent and location of VMPFC activation during the IGT, a finding not captured in the group analysis: There is no correlation between IGT performance and extent of activation in the right VMPFC, although there is such a correlation between left VMPFC activation and IGT performance.},

This allows tests of predictions about the interplay of these emotions and interperson attention differences at each point in time during exposure. Surprise and joy effectively concentrate attention and retain viewers. However, importantly, the level rather than the velocity of surprise affects attention concentration most, whereas the velocity rather than the level of joy affects viewer retention most. The effect of joy is asymmetric, with higher gains for increases than losses for decreases.

	abstract = {The authors examine consumers’ visual attention during repeated exposures to print advertisements using eye-tracking methodology. The authors propose a statistical model comprising submodels for two key measures of visual attention to elements of the advertisement: attention duration and inter- and intraelement saccades. These measures are vital to understanding attention wear-out and the impact of repetition on advertising effectiveness but have not been considered in previous research. The results of two studies show that (1) attention duration decreases significantly across advertising repetitions and (2) attentional scanpaths, as measured through saccades, remain constant across advertising repetitions and across experimentally induced and naturally occurring conditions. Scanpaths obey a stationary, reversible, first-order Markov process. The authors offer implications for attention theory and advertising processing.},

However, the value of these methods in predicting advertising success remains underresearched. Using a unique experimental protocol to assess responses to 30-second television ads, the authors capture many measures of advertising effectiveness across six commonly used methods (traditional self-reports, implicit measures, eye tracking, biometrics, electroencephalography, and functional magnetic resonance imaging). These measures have been shown to reliably tap into higher-level constructs commonly used in advertising research: attention, affect, memory, and desirability. Using time-series data on sales and gross rating points, the authors attempt to relate individual-level response to television ads in the lab to the ads’ aggregate, market-level elasticities. The authors show that functional magnetic resonance imaging measures explain the most variance in advertising elasticities beyond the baseline traditional measures. Notably, activity in the ventral striatum is the strongest predictor of real-world, market-level response to advertising. The authors discuss the findings and their significant implications for theory, research, and practice.},

Thus, this distance can be used to determine the degree of resemblance between two objects that are superimposed on one another. Efficient algorithms for computing the Hausdorff distance between all possible relative positions of a binary image and a model are presented. The focus is primarily on the case in which the model is only allowed to translate with respect to the image. The techniques are extended to rigid motion. The Hausdorff distance computation differs from many other shape comparison methods in that no correspondence between the model and the image is derived. The method is quite tolerant of small position errors such as those that occur with edge detectors and other feature extraction methods. It is shown that the method extends naturally to the problem of comparing a portion of a model against an image.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Use of multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to predict the cognitive state of a subject during task performance has become a popular focus of fMRI studies. The input to these analyses consists of activation patterns corresponding to different tasks or stimulus types. These activation patterns are fairly straightforward to calculate for blocked trials or slow event-related designs, but for rapid event-related designs the evoked BOLD signal for adjacent trials will overlap in time, complicating the identification of signal unique to specific trials. Rapid event-related designs are often preferred because they allow for more stimuli to be presented and subjects tend to be more focused on the task, and thus it would be beneficial to be able to use these types of designs in MVPA analyses. The present work compares 8 different models for estimating trial-by-trial activation patterns for a range of rapid event-related designs varying by interstimulus interval and signal-to-noise ratio. The most effective approach obtains each trial's estimate through a general linear model including a regressor for that trial as well as another regressor for all other trials. Through the analysis of both simulated and real data we have found that this model shows some improvement over the standard approaches for obtaining activation patterns. The resulting trial-by-trial estimates are more representative of the true activation magnitudes, leading to a boost in classification accuracy in fast event-related designs with higher signal-to-noise. This provides the potential for fMRI studies that allow simultaneous optimization of both univariate and MVPA approaches.},

The authors overcome this challenge by applying deep learning–based natural language processing on data that tracks individual-level review reading, searching, and purchasing behaviors on an e-commerce site to investigate how consumers use review content. They extract quality and price content from 500,000 reviews of 600 product categories and achieve two objectives. First, the authors describe consumers’ review-content-reading behaviors. Although consumers do not read review content all the time, they do rely on it for products that are expensive or of uncertain quality. Second, the authors quantify the causal impact of read-review content on sales by using supervised deep learning to tag six theory-driven content dimensions and applying a regression discontinuity in time design. They find that aesthetics and price content significantly increase conversion across almost all product categories. Review content has a higher impact on sales when the average rating is higher, ratings variance is lower, the market is more competitive or immature, or brand information is not accessible. A counterfactual simulation suggests that reordering reviews based on content can have the same effect as a 1.6\% price cut for boosting conversion.},

After accounting for selection bias on the inclusion of image content, the authors find a significant and robust positive mere presence effect of image content on user engagement in both product categories on Twitter. They also find that high-quality and professionally shot pictures consistently lead to higher engagement on both platforms for both product categories. However, the effect of colorfulness varies by product category, while the presence of human face and image–text fit can induce higher user engagement on Twitter but not on Instagram. These findings shed light on how to improve social media engagement using image content.},

Research has not established which neuropsychological mechanisms support lending decisions, nor whether their influence extends to markets involving significant financial incentives. In two studies, we found that neural affective mechanisms influence the success of requests for microloans. In a large Internet database of microloan requests (N = 13,500), we found that positive affective features of photographs promoted the success of those requests. We then established that neural activity (i.e., in the nucleus accumbens) and self-reported positive arousal in a neuroimaging sample (N = 28) predicted the success of loan requests on the Internet, above and beyond the effects of the neuroimaging sample?s own choices (i.e., to lend or not). These findings suggest that elicitation of positive arousal can promote the success of loan requests, both in the laboratory and on the Internet.

The authors use text-mining and machine learning tools to automatically process and analyze the raw text in over 120,000 loan requests from Prosper, an online crowdfunding platform. Including in the predictive model the textual information in the loan significantly helps predict loan default and can have substantial financial implications. The authors find that loan requests written by defaulting borrowers are more likely to include words related to their family, mentions of God, the borrower’s financial and general hardship, pleading lenders for help, and short-term-focused words.

However, the applicability of this method to consumer marketing research remains uncertain, partly because of the expense required. In this article, the authors demonstrate that neural measurements made with a relatively low-cost and widely available measurement method—electroencephalography (EEG)—can predict future choices of consumer products. In the experiment, participants viewed individual consumer products in isolation, without making any actual choices, while their neural activity was measured with EEG. At the end of the experiment, participants were offered choices between pairs of the same products. The authors find that neural activity measured from a midfrontal electrode displays an increase in the N200 component and a weaker theta band power that correlates with a more preferred product. Using recent techniques for relating neural measurements to choice prediction, they demonstrate that these measures predict subsequent choices. Moreover, the accuracy of prediction depends on both the ordinal and cardinal distance of the EEG data; the larger the difference in EEG activity between two products, the better the predictive accuracy.},

However, it assumes that data points are Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) so that samples used in the training and test sets can be selected randomly and uniformly. In Human Activity Recognition datasets, we note that the samples produced by the same subjects are likely to be correlated due to diverse factors. Hence, k-fold cross validation may overestimate the performance of activity recognizers, in particular when overlapping sliding windows are used. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Subject Cross Validation on the performance of Human Activity Recognition, both with non-overlapping and with overlapping sliding windows. Results show that k-fold cross validation artificially increases the performance of recognizers by about 10\%, and even by 16\% when overlapping windows are used. In addition, we do not observe any performance gain from the use of overlapping windows. We conclude that Human Activity Recognition systems should be evaluated by Subject Cross Validation, and that overlapping windows are not worth their extra computational cost.},

	abstract = {There is evidence in neuroscience that the brain processes negative visual stimuli in a different manner than positive ones. Our study investigates, whether it is possible to transfer these findings to one specific, often-neglected marketing stimulus, package design. For this purpose, we measured the brain activity of subjects while they had to make decisions about the attractiveness of certain fast moving consumer good packages. As predicted by consumer neuroscience, we found that attractive and unattractive packages are able to trigger different cortical activity changes. Contrasting attractive versus unattractive packages, revealed significant cortical activity changes in visual areas of the occipital lobe and the precuneus – regions associated with the processing of visual stimuli and attention. On the individual level, we found significant activity changes within regions of reward processing. On the other hand by contrasting unattractive versus attractive packages we found an increased activity in areas of the frontal lobe and insula cortex, regions often associated with processing aversive stimuli such as unfair offers or disgusting pictures. Although, these results are without any doubt preliminary they might explain why attractive packages gain more attention at the point-of-sale and this, in turn, positively influences turnovers of fast moving consumer goods.

We show that the BI-LSTM-CRF model can efficiently use both past and future input features thanks to a bidirectional LSTM component. It can also use sentence level tag information thanks to a CRF layer. The BI-LSTM-CRF model can produce state of the art (or close to) accuracy on POS, chunking and NER data sets.

First, buyers often have irregular purchase patterns, as the authors observe in the high-tech industry. Second, marketing efforts take considerable time to build a relationship with a customer. The authors attempt to precisely recover hidden buyer–seller relationship states to capture the effect of marketing contacts in B2B markets. The authors build a comprehensive hierarchical Bayesian bivariate Tobit hidden Markov model to assess the return on marketing in B2B markets. They use a recursive computing method—a forward–backward Gibbs sampler method—to retrieve the relationship states. The results suggest that marketing contacts have a heterogeneous long- and short-term impact on customers' purchasing behavior through changes in the buyer–seller relationship states. This study provides practical value to business marketers to measure the return on marketing investment in buyer–seller relationships.},

	abstract = {Although email marketing is highly profitable and widely used by marketers, it has received limited attention in the marketing literature. Extant research has focused on either customers’ email responses or the “average” effect of emails on purchases. In this article, the authors use data from a U.S. home improvement retailer to study customers’ email open and purchase behaviors by using a unified hidden Markov and copula framework. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the authors find that email-active customers are not necessarily active in purchases, and vice versa. Furthermore, the number of emails sent by the retailer has a nonlinear effect on both the retailer's short- and long-term profitability. Through a counterfactual study, the authors provide a decision support system to guide retailers in making optimal email contact decisions. This study shows that sending the right number of emails is vital for long-term profitability. For example, sending four (ten) emails instead of the optimal number of seven emails can cause the retailer to lose 32\% (16\%) of its lifetime profit per customer.},

Furthermore, these techniques allow longitudinal follow-ups of single subjects via repeated measurements. sMRI- or fMRI-based biomarkers have been adopted separately to diagnose MCI; however, there has not been a systematic effort to integrate sMRI- and fMRI-based features to increase MCI detection accuracy. This study investigated whether the detection of MCI can be improved via the integration of biomarkers identified from both sMRI and fMRI modalities. Regional volume sizes and neuronal activity levels of brains from MCI subjects were compared with those from healthy controls and used to identify biomarkers from sMRI and fMRI data, respectively. In the subsequent classification phase, MCI was automatically detected using a support vector machine algorithm that employed the identified sMRI- and fMRI-based biomarkers as an input feature vector. The results indicate that the fMRI-based biomarkers provided more information for detecting MCI than the sMRI-based biomarkers. Moreover, the integrated feature sets using the sMRI- and fMRI-based biomarkers consistently showed greater detection accuracy than the feature sets based only on the fMRI-based biomarkers. The results demonstrate that integration of sMRI and fMRI modalities can provide supplemental information to improve the diagnosis of MCI relative to either the sMRI or fMRI modalities alone.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the current study was to develop an objective tool based on dual-task performance for screening early-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI of the Alzheimer’s type). Dual-task involved a simultaneous execution of a sensor-based upper-extremity function (UEF) motor task (normal or rapid speed) and a cognitive task of counting numbers backward (by ones or threes). Motor function speed and variability were recorded and compared between cognitive groups using ANOVAs, adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index. Cognitive indexes were developed using multivariable ordinal logistic models to predict the cognitive status using UEF parameters. Ninety-one participants were recruited; 35 cognitive normal (CN, age = 83.8 ± 6.9), 34 MCI (age = 83.9 ± 6.6), and 22 AD (age = 84.1 ± 6.1). Flexion number and sensor-based motion variability parameters, within the normal pace elbow flexion, showed significant between-group differences (maximum effect size of 1.10 for CN versus MCI and 1.39 for CN versus AD, p {\textless} 0.0001). Using these parameters, the cognitive status (both MCI and AD) was predicted with a receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.83 (sensitivity = 0.82 and specificity = 0.72). Findings suggest that measures of motor function speed and accuracy within a more practical upper-extremity test (instead of walking) may provide enough complexity for cognitive impairment assessment.},

	abstract = {Several studies have differentiated Alzheimer's disease (AD) using cerebral image features derived from MR brain images. In this study, we were interested in combining hippocampus and amygdala volumes and entorhinal cortex thickness to improve the performance of AD differentiation. Thus, our objective was to investigate the useful features obtained from MRI for classification of AD patients using support vector machine (SVM). T1-weighted MR brain images of 100 AD patients and 100 normal subjects were processed using FreeSurfer software to measure hippocampus and amygdala volumes and entorhinal cortex thicknesses in both brain hemispheres. Relative volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were calculated to correct variation in individual head size. SVM was employed with five combinations of features (H: hippocampus relative volumes, A: amygdala relative volumes, E: entorhinal cortex thicknesses, HA: hippocampus and amygdala relative volumes and ALL: all features). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the method. AUC values of five combinations were 0.8575 (H), 0.8374 (A), 0.8422 (E), 0.8631 (HA) and 0.8906 (ALL). Although “ALL” provided the highest AUC, there were no statistically significant differences among them except for “A” feature. Our results showed that all suggested features may be feasible for computer-aided classification of AD patients.},

	abstract = {Efficacy of future treatments depends on biomarkers identifying patients with mild cognitive impairment at highest risk for transitioning to Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we applied recently developed analysis techniques to investigate differences in subcortical shape and volume alterations in patients with stable mild cognitive impairment (n=23, age range 59-82, 47.8\% female), future converters at baseline (n=10, age range 66-84, 90\% female) and at time of conversion (age range 68-87) compared to group-wise age and gender matched healthy control subjects (n=23, age range 61-81, 47.8\% female; n=10, age range 66-82, 80\% female; n=10, age range 68-82, 70\% female). Additionally, we studied cortical thinning and global and local measures of hippocampal atrophy as known key imaging markers for Alzheimer’s disease. Apart from bilateral striatal volume reductions, no morphometric alterations were found in cognitively stable patients. In contrast, we identified shape alterations in striatal and thalamic regions in future converters at baseline and at time of conversion. These shape alterations were paralleled by Alzheimer’s disease like patterns of left hemispheric morphometric changes (cortical thinning in medial temporal regions, hippocampal total and subfield atrophy) in future converters at baseline with progression to similar right hemispheric alterations at time of conversion. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that subcortical shape alterations may outperform hippocampal volume in identifying future converters at baseline. These results further confirm the key role of early cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy in the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease. But first and foremost, and by distinguishing future converters but not patients with stable cognitive abilities from cognitively normal subjects, our results support the value of early subcortical shape alterations and reduced hippocampal subfield volumes as potential markers for the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {In the recent years, deep learning has gained huge fame in solving problems from various fields including medical image analysis. This work proposes a deep convolutional neural network based pipeline for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its stages using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Alzheimer's disease causes permanent damage to the brain cells associated with memory and thinking skills. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's in elderly people is quite difficult and requires a highly discriminative feature representation for classification due to similar brain patterns and pixel intensities. Deep learning techniques are capable of learning such representations from data. In this paper, a 4-way classifier is implemented to classify Alzheimer's (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and healthy persons. Experiments are performed using ADNI dataset on a high performance graphical processing unit based system and new state-of-the-art results are obtained for multiclass classification of the disease. The proposed technique results in a prediction accuracy of 98.8\%, which is a noticeable increase in accuracy as compared to the previous studies and clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Setting Southwestern tertiary academic medical center, Tucson, Arizona. Participants Convenience subsample of the Arizona Frailty Cohort, a community-dwelling older adults (≥65; n = 117; 50 nonfrail, 51 prefrail, 16 frail). Measurements Wireless sensors were attached to the upper arm and forearm with bands, and subjects performed repetitive elbow flexion for 20 seconds on each side. Information was extracted on objective slowness, weakness, exhaustion, and flexibility measures, and associations between parameters and Fried frailty categories were determined. Results Speed of elbow flexion (slowness) was 29\% less in prefrail and 59\% less in frail than in nonfrail controls (P {\textless} .001), power of movement (weakness) was 61\% less in prefrail and 89\% less frail (P {\textless} .001), and speed variation (exhaustion) was 35\% more in prefrail and 272\% more in frail (P {\textless} .001). Using elbow flexion parameters in regression models, sensitivity and specificity of 100\% were achieved in predicting frailty and sensitivity of 87\% and specificity of 95\% in predicting prefrailty compared to Fried frailty category. Conclusion The suggested innovative upper extremity frailty assessment method integrates low-cost sensors, and the physical assessment is easily performed in less than 1 minute. The uniqueness of the proposed technology is its applicability in older nonambulatory individuals, such as those in emergency settings. Further improvement is warrant to make it suitable for routine clinical applications.},

	abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has often been studied in its association with dementia, yet higher rates of reversion to normal cognition than progression to dementia suggest that MCI does not necessarily lead to dementia. Compared to the numerous studies on MCI progression, relatively few have examined reversion. This paper highlights the current literature on characteristics and predictive factors of MCI reversion, along with an overview of studies on MCI patients who remain diagnostically stable (i.e., MCI stability). Of the available studies, predictors of reversion have been noted in areas of cognitive/global functioning, demographic/genetic/biomarker data, and personality/lifestyle factors. However, there is a need for increased study of MCI reversion, considering that patients in this group can fluctuate between different trajectories of MCI (e.g., normal cognition back to MCI or even progression to dementia) within a given follow-up time period. Further examination of reversion via a longitudinal, multifactorial approach would better inform clinicians regarding the likelihood of reversion amongst MCI patients and subsequently modify treatment methods accordingly. Furthermore, researchers would have greater power in detecting treatment effects in their clinical intervention studies of early dementia by improving selection criteria to exclude MCI participants who are more likely to revert and remain cognitively normal than progress to a dementia.},

OBJECTIVE: To characterize clinically subjects with MCI cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
DESIGN: A prospective, longitudinal inception cohort.
SETTING: General community clinic.
PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 76 consecutively evaluated subjects with MCI were compared with 234 healthy control subjects and 106 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), all from a community setting as part of the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, Rochester, Minn.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The 3 groups of individuals were compared on demographic factors and measures of cognitive function including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised, Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, Dementia Rating Scale, Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test, and Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Clinical classifications of dementia and AD were determined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria, respectively.
RESULTS: The primary distinction between control subjects and subjects with MCI was in the area of memory, while other cognitive functions were comparable. However, when the subjects with MCI were compared with the patients with very mild AD, memory performance was similar, but patients with AD were more impaired in other cognitive domains as well. Longitudinal performance demonstrated that the subjects with MCI declined at a rate greater than that of the controls but less rapidly than the patients with mild AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who meet the criteria for MCI can be differentiated from healthy control subjects and those with very mild AD. They appear to constitute a clinical entity that can be characterized for treatment interventions.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to project the future prevalence and incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States and the potential impact of interventions to delay disease onset. METHODS: The numbers of individuals in the United States with Alzheimer's disease and the numbers of newly diagnosed cases that can be expected over the next 50 years were estimated from a model that used age-specific incidence rates summarized from several epidemiological studies, US mortality rates, and US Bureau of the Census projections. RESULTS: in 1997, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease in the United States was 2.32 million (range: 1.09 to 4.58 million); of these individuals, 68\% were female. It is projected that the prevalence will nearly quadruple in the next 50 years, by which time approximately 1 in 45 Americans will be afflicted with the disease. Currently, the annual number of new incident cases in 360,000. If interventions could delay onset of the disease by 2 years, after 50 years there would be nearly 2 million fewer cases than projected; if onset could be delayed by 1 year, there would be nearly 800,000 fewer prevalent cases. CONCLUSIONS: As the US population ages, Alzheimer's disease will become an enormous public health problem. interventions that could delay disease onset even modestly would have a major public health impact.},

In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis.

	abstract = {Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the ADNI dataset.},

While the CBIR is highly desired, it has not been applied to clinical neuroradiology, because clinically relevant neuroradiological features are swamped by a huge number of noisy and unrelated voxel information. Thus, effective dimension reduction is the key to successful CBIR. We propose a novel dimensional compression method based on 3D convolutional autoencoders (3D-CAE), which was applied to the ADNI2 3D brain MRI dataset. Our method succeeded in compressing 5 million voxel information to only 150 dimensions, while preserving clinically relevant neuroradiological features.

Blood oxygen level dependent fMRI was performed evaluating encoding-associated signal and resting-state default mode network signal differences between the two risk groups. Neurocognitive testing revealed that the high risk group performed worse on category fluency testing, but the groups were equivalent on all other cognitive measures. During encoding of novel face–name pairs, there were no regions of encoding-associated BOLD activations that were different in the high risk group. Encoding-associated deactivations were greater in magnitude in the low risk group in the medial and right lateral parietal cortex, similar to findings in AD studies. The resting-state DMN analysis demonstrated nine regions in the prefrontal, orbital frontal, temporal and parietal lobes that distinguished the two risk groups. Resting-state DMN analysis could distinguish risk groups with an effect size of 3.35, compared to an effect size of 1.39 using encoding-associated fMRI techniques. Imaging of the resting state avoids performance related variability seen in activation fMRI, is less complicated to acquire and standardize, does not require radio-isotopes, and may be more effective at identifying functional pathology associated with AD risk compared to non-resting fMRI techniques.},

	abstract = {Many machine learning and pattern classification methods have been applied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, rather than predicting categorical variables as in classification, several pattern regression methods have also been used to estimate continuous clinical variables from brain images. However, most existing regression methods focus on estimating multiple clinical variables separately and thus cannot utilize the intrinsic useful correlation information among different clinical variables. On the other hand, in those regression methods, only a single modality of data (usually only the structural MRI) is often used, without considering the complementary information that can be provided by different modalities. In this paper, we propose a general methodology, namely multi-modal multi-task (M3T) learning, to jointly predict multiple variables from multi-modal data. Here, the variables include not only the clinical variables used for regression but also the categorical variable used for classification, with different tasks corresponding to prediction of different variables. Specifically, our method contains two key components, i.e., (1) a multi-task feature selection which selects the common subset of relevant features for multiple variables from each modality, and (2) a multi-modal support vector machine which fuses the above-selected features from all modalities to predict multiple (regression and classification) variables. To validate our method, we perform two sets of experiments on ADNI baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) data from 45 AD patients, 91 MCI patients, and 50 healthy controls (HC). In the first set of experiments, we estimate two clinical variables such as Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), as well as one categorical variable (with value of ‘AD’, ‘MCI’ or ‘HC’), from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. In the second set of experiments, we predict the 2-year changes of MMSE and ADAS-Cog scores and also the conversion of MCI to AD from the baseline MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF data. The results on both sets of experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3T learning scheme can achieve better performance on both regression and classification tasks than the conventional learning methods.},

Our goal was to forecast the global burden of Alzheimer’s disease and evaluate the potential impact of interventions that delay disease onset or progression.
Methods
A stochastic, multistate model was used in conjunction with United Nations worldwide population forecasts and data from epidemiological studies of the risks of Alzheimer’s disease.
Results
In 2006, the worldwide prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease was 26.6 million. By 2050, the prevalence will quadruple, by which time 1 in 85 persons worldwide will be living with the disease. We estimate about 43\% of prevalent cases need a high level of care, equivalent to that of a nursing home. If interventions could delay both disease onset and progression by a modest 1 year, there would be nearly 9.2 million fewer cases of the disease in 2050, with nearly the entire decline attributable to decreases in persons needing a high level of care.
Conclusions
We face a looming global epidemic of Alzheimer’s disease as the world’s population ages. Modest advances in therapeutic and preventive strategies that lead to even small delays in the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease can significantly reduce the global burden of this disease.},

A statistically significant overlap between the resting-state functional connectivity map and the task-activation map due to bilateral finger tapping was obtained. Similar results have been obtained in the auditory and visual cortex. Because the pulse sequence used for collecting data was sensitive to blood flow and blood oxygenation, these low-frequency fluctuations of signal intensity may have arisen from variations of both. The objective of this study was simultaneously to determine the contribution of the blood oxygenation level signal and the flow signal to physiological fluctuations in the resting brain using the flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery pulse sequence. In all subjects, the functional connectivity maps obtained from BOLD had a greater coincidence with task-activation maps than the corresponding functional connectivity maps obtained from blood-flow signals at the same level of statistical significance. Results of this study suggest that while variations in blood flow might contribute to functional connectivity maps, BOLD signals play a dominant role in the mechanism that gives rise to functional connectivity in the resting human brain. © 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of default mode network (DMN) brain activity during resting is recently gaining attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker to diagnose incipient Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this study was to determine which method of data processing provides highest diagnostic power and to define metrics to further optimize the diagnostic value. fMRI was acquired in 21 healthy subjects, 17 subjects with mild cognitive impairment and 15 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and data evaluated both with volumes of interest (VOI)-based signal time course evaluations and independent component analyses (ICA). The first approach determines the amount of DMN region interconnectivity (as expressed with correlation coefficients); the second method determines the magnitude of DMN coactivation. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotyping was available in 41 of the subjects examined. Diagnostic power (expressed as accuracy) of data of a single DMN region in independent component analyses was 64\%, that of a single correlation of time courses between 2 DMN regions was 71\%, respectively. With multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis and data from various regions, accuracy could be increased to 97\% (sensitivity 100\%, specificity 95\%). In nondemented subjects, no significant differences in activity within DMN could be detected comparing ApoE ε4 allele carriers and ApoE ε4 allele noncarriers. However, there were some indications that fMRI might yield useful information given a larger sample. Time course correlation analyses seem to outperform independent component analyses in the identification of patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, multivariate analyses combining both methods of analysis by considering the activity of various parts of the DMN as well as the interconnectivity between these regions are required to achieve optimal and clinically acceptable diagnostic power.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have led to the proposal that patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may have disturbed functional connectivity between different brain regions. Furthermore, recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have also shown that low-frequency ({\textless}0.08 Hz) fluctuations (LFF) of the blood oxygenation level-dependent signals were abnormal in several brain areas of AD patients. However, few studies have investigated disturbed LFF connectivity in AD patients. By using resting-state fMRI, this study sought to investigate the abnormal functional connectivities throughout the entire brain of early AD patients, and analyze the global distribution of these abnormalities. For this purpose, the authors divided the whole brain into 116 regions and identified abnormal connectivities by comparing the correlation coefficients of each pair. Compared with healthy controls, AD patients had decreased positive correlations between the prefrontal and parietal lobes, but increased positive correlations within the prefrontal lobe, parietal lobe, and occipital lobe. The AD patients also had decreased negative correlations (closer to zero) between two intrinsically anti-correlated networks that had previously been found in the resting brain. By using resting-state fMRI, our results supported previous studies that have reported an anterior–posterior disconnection phenomenon and increased within-lobe functional connectivity in AD patients. In addition, the results also suggest that AD may disturb the correlation/anti-correlation effect in the two intrinsically anti-correlated networks. Hum Brain Mapp 2006. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Compared with controls and aMCI, AD was associated with opposing connectivity effects in the DMN (decreased) and frontal networks (enhanced). The only RS abnormality found in aMCI patients compared with controls was a precuneus connectivity reduction in the DMN. RS fMRI group differences were only partly related to gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the mean executive network connectivity was positively associated with frontal-executive and language neuropsychological scores. These results suggest that AD is associated with an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks, which extends well beyond the DMN. In AD, the limited resources of the DMN may be paralleled, in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency, by an increased prefrontal connectivity. A medial parietal RS fMRI signal change seems to be present since the early phase of AD.},

However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in “default mode network” previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD.},

Undirected functional connectivity alterations occur in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD has been the subject of much investigation. However, the abnormal patterns underlying directed functional connectivity remain poorly understood. In this work, to identify the changes in directed functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions, Granger causality analysis (GCA) based on voxels was applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data from 29 AD, 65 MCI and 30 normal control (NC) subjects. The results show significant differences in directed functional connectivity patterns among the three groups. Compared with the NC group, brain regions showing changes in directed functional connectivity with the hippocampus were few and mainly included the temporal lobe, frontal lobe and cingulate cortex in the MCI group. However, abnormal directed connectivity in the AD group was obviously larger in terms of the number or size of the voxels and was more widely distributed. Most of the abnormal connections were unidirectional and were asymmetric in the two hemispheres. The findings of this study reveal abnormalities in the hippocampus of MCI and AD patients in transmitting and receiving information and offers insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying MCI and AD.},

In particular, recent advances in deep learning have opened a new era in support of multimedia healthcare distribution. For earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease, the study suggested the Improved Deep Learning Algorithm (IDLA) and statistically significant text information. The specific information in clinical text includes the age, sex and genes of the person and apolipoprotein E; the brain function is established using resting-state functional data (MRI) for the measurement of connectivity in the brain regions. A specialized network of autoencoders is used in earlier diagnosis to distinguish between natural aging and disorder progression. The suggested approach incorporates effectively biased neural network functionality and allows a reliable Alzheimer's disease recognition. In comparison with conventional classifiers depends on time series R-fMRI results, the proposed deep learning algorithm has improved significantly and, in the best cases, the standard deviation reduced by 45\%, indicating the forecast model is more reliable and efficient in relation to conventional methodologies. The work examines the benefits of improved deep learning algorithms from recognizing high-dimensional information in healthcare and can lead to the early diagnosis and prevention of Alzheimer's disease.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder accounting for 70\%–80\% dementia cases worldwide. Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100\%, 96.85\%, 97.38\%, 97.43\%, 97.40\% and 98.01\% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92\% and 97.88\% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The Analysis of results indicate that classification and prediction of neurodegenerative brain disorders such as AD using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced deep learning methods is promising for clinical decision making and have the potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.},

Using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) scans of 331 participants, we obtained functional 3-dimensional (3-D) independent component spatial maps for use as features in classification and regression tasks. A 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was developed for the classification task. MMSE scores were predicted using: linear least square regression (LLSR), support vector regression, bagging-based ensemble regression, and tree regression with group independent component analysis (gICA) features. To improve MMSE regression performance, we applied feature optimization methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The mean balanced test accuracy was 85.27\% for the classification of AD versus healthy controls. The medial visual, default mode, dorsal attention, executive, and auditory related networks were mainly associated with AD. The maximum clinical MMSE score prediction accuracy with the LLSR method applied on gICA combined with SVM-RFE features had the lowest root mean square error (3.27 ± 0.58) and the highest R2 value (0.63 ± 0.02). Classification of AD and healthy controls can be successfully achieved using only rs-fMRI and MMSE scores can be accurately predicted using functional independent component features. In the absence of trained clinicians, AD disease status and clinical MMSE scores can be jointly predicted using 3-D deep learning and regression learning approaches with rs-fMRI data.},

	abstract = {Atlas normalization, as commonly used by functional data analysis, provides an automated solution to the widely encountered problem of correcting for head size variation in regional and whole-brain morphometric analyses, so long as an age- and population-appropriate target atlas is used. In the present article, we develop and validate an atlas normalization procedure for head size correction using manual total intracranial volume (TIV) measurement as a reference. The target image used for atlas transformation consisted of a merged young and old-adult template specifically created for cross age-span normalization. Automated atlas transformation generated the Atlas Scaling Factor (ASF) defined as the volume-scaling factor required to match each individual to the atlas target. Because atlas normalization equates head size, the ASF should be proportional to TIV. A validation analysis was performed on 147 subjects to evaluate ASF as a proxy for manual TIV measurement. In addition, 19 subjects were imaged on multiple days to assess test–retest reliability. Results indicated that the ASF was (1) equivalent to manual TIV normalization (r = 0.93), (2) reliable across multiple imaging sessions (r = 1.00; mean absolute percentage of difference = 0.51\%), (3) able to connect between-gender head size differences, and (4) minimally biased in demented older adults with marked atrophy. Hippocampal volume differences between nondemented (n = 49) and demented (n = 50) older adults (measured manually) were equivalent whether corrected using manual TIV or automated ASF (effect sizes of 1.29 and 1.46, respectively). To provide normative values, ASF was used to automatically derive estimated TIV (eTIV) in 335 subjects aged 15–96 including both clinically characterized nondemented (n = 77) and demented (n = 90) older adults. Differences in eTIV between nondemented and demented groups were negligible, thus failing to support the hypothesis that large premorbid brain size moderates Alzheimer's disease. Gender was the only robust factor that influenced eTIV. Men showed an approximately ∼12\% larger eTIV than women. These results demonstrate that atlas normalization using appropriate template images provides a robust, automated method for head size correction that is equivalent to manual TIV correction in studies of aging and dementia. Thus, atlas normalization provides a common framework for both morphometric and functional data analysis.},

	abstract = {Background
Clinical imaging data are typically stored and transferred in the DICOM format, whereas the NIfTI format has been widely adopted by scientists in the neuroimaging community. Therefore, a vital initial step in processing the data is to convert images from the complicated DICOM format to the much simpler NIfTI format. While there are a number of tools that usually handle DICOM to NIfTI conversion seamlessly, some variations can disrupt this process.
New method
We provide some insight into the challenges faced with image conversion. First, different manufacturers implement the DICOM format differently which complicates the conversion. Second, different modalities and sub-modalities may need special treatment during conversion. Lastly, the image transferring and archiving can also impact the DICOM conversion.
Results
We present results in several error-prone domains, including the slice order for functional imaging, phase encoding direction for distortion correction, effect of diffusion gradient direction, and effect of gantry correction for some imaging modality.
Comparison with existing methods
Conversion tools are often designed for a specific manufacturer or modality. The tools and insight we present here are aimed at different manufacturers or modalities.
Conclusions
The imaging conversion is complicated by the variation of images. An understanding of the conversion basics can be helpful for identifying the source of the error. Here we provide users with simple methods for detecting and correcting problems. This also serves as an overview for developers who wish to either develop their own tools or adapt the open source tools created by the authors.},

Identification of individuals prior to the development of significant clinical symptoms is imperative in order to have the greatest treatment impact by maintaining cognitive abilities and preserving quality of life. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers considerable promise as a non-invasive tool for detecting early functional brain changes in asymptomatic adults. In fact, evidence to date indicates that functional brain decline precedes structural decline in preclinical samples. Therefore, fMRI may offer the unique ability to capture the dynamic state of change in the degenerating brain. This review examines the clinical utility of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in those at risk for AD as well as in early AD. We provide an overview of fMRI findings in at-risk groups by virtue of genetic susceptibility or mild cognitive decline followed by an appraisal of the methodological issues concerning the diagnostic usefulness of fMRI in early AD. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and propose that BOLD-fMRI in combination with cerebral blood flow or diffusion techniques will provide a more complete accounting of the neurovascular changes that occur in preclinical AD and thus improve our ability to reliably detect early brain changes prior to disease onset.},

	abstract = {Using resting state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the connectivity patterns of the default mode (DMN), frontoparietal, executive, and salience networks were explored in 13 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 12 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, and 13 healthy controls. Compared with controls and aMCI, AD was associated with opposing connectivity effects in the DMN (decreased) and frontal networks (enhanced). The only RS abnormality found in aMCI patients compared with controls was a precuneus connectivity reduction in the DMN. RS fMRI group differences were only partly related to gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the mean executive network connectivity was positively associated with frontal-executive and language neuropsychological scores. These results suggest that AD is associated with an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks, which extends well beyond the DMN. In AD, the limited resources of the DMN may be paralleled, in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency, by an increased prefrontal connectivity. A medial parietal RS fMRI signal change seems to be present since the early phase of AD.},

	abstract = {Normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cause profound changes in the brain’s structure and function. AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer’s disease. We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity—seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease.},

However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in “default mode network” previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD.},

Study of brain network on the basis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided promising results to investigate changes in connectivity among different brain regions because of diseases. Graph theory can efficiently characterize different aspects of the brain network by calculating measures of integration and segregation.
Method
In this study, we combine graph theoretical approaches with advanced machine learning methods to study functional brain network alteration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Support vector machine (SVM) was used to explore the ability of graph measures in diagnosis of AD. We applied our method on the resting-state fMRI data of twenty patients with AD and twenty age and gender matched healthy subjects. The data were preprocessed and each subject’s graph was constructed by parcellation of the whole brain into 90 distinct regions using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. The graph measures were then calculated and used as the discriminating features. Extracted network-based features were fed to different feature selection algorithms to choose most significant features. In addition to the machine learning approach, statistical analysis was performed on connectivity matrices to find altered connectivity patterns in patients with AD.
Results
Using the selected features, we were able to accurately classify patients with AD from healthy subjects with accuracy of 100\%.
Conclusion
Results of this study show that pattern recognition and graph of brain network, on the basis of the resting state fMRI data, can efficiently assist in the diagnosis of AD.
Significance
Classification based on the resting-state fMRI can be used as a non-invasive and automatic tool to diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal “knowledge diffusion” process, when methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French epidemiological study: “Bordeaux dataset”. The experimental results show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 \% and 85 \% for ADNI subset and “Bordeaux dataset” respectively. For the most challenging group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach accuracies of 78.22 \% and 72.23 \% for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification results by 9 \% in average for these three categories. Results demonstrate very promising classification performance and simplicity compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric AD diagnosis methods.},

In this paper, we used convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer's brain from normal healthy brain. The importance of classifying this kind of medical data is to potentially develop a predict model or system in order to recognize the type disease from normal subjects or to estimate the stage of the disease. Classification of clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease has been always challenging and most problematic part has been always selecting the most discriminative features. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on trained data reached 96.85\%. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is most powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.

Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described.

Objective
To determine the effect of 2 different dual tasks on gait variability in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with control subjects.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Memory clinic at a university hospital.
Participants
Older adults with MCI (n=43) and cognitively normal control subjects (n=25) from the community. Gait was assessed under single (usual walking) and dual tasking (naming animals and subtracting serial 7s), using an electronic walkway.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
The dependent variable was the coefficient of variation of gait variability, a marker of gait stability and an established risk factor for falls. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine main effects (group, task) and their interaction.
Results
A significant difference was found within and between groups (P=.016) of increasing gait variability as dual-task complexity increased. Gait velocity decreased within groups as dual-task complexity increased. The magnitude of increased gait variability across tasks was greater for the MCI group (2.68\%– 9.84\%) than for the control group (1.86\%–3.74\%), showing a significant between-group difference (P=.041).
Conclusions
Dual-task load significantly increased gait variability in the MCI group compared with the control group, an effect that was larger than the changes in gait velocity. The magnitude of this impairment on gait stability was related to the complexity of the dual task applied. Our findings help to explain the high risk of falls recently described in older adults with MCI, and may help in the identification of fall risk in cognitively impaired persons.},

	abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative brain order that has currently no cure for it. Hence, early diagnosis of such disease using computer-aided systems is a subject of great importance and extensive research amongst researchers. Nowadays, deep learning or particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) is getting more attention due to its state-of-the-art performances in variety of computer vision tasks such as visual object classification, detection and segmentation. Several recent studies, that have used brain MRI scans and deep learning have shown promising results for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. However, most common issue with deep learning architectures such as CNN is that they require large amount of data for training. In this paper, a mathematical model PFSECTL based on transfer learning is used in which a CNN architecture, VGG-16 trained on ImageNet dataset is used as a feature extractor for the classification task. Experimentation is performed on data collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The accuracy of the 3-way classification using the described method is 95.73\% for the validation set.},

Computerized methods have been shown to be equally or more e↵ective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract hand–crafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross–domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC). Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classiﬁcation performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches.},

However, accessing single process relationships is absolutely mandatory when aiming at a deeper understanding of neurovascular coupling and necessitates studies on the individual building blocks of the vascular response. Combined fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy studies have been performed to validate the correlation of the BOLD signal to the hemodynamic changes in the brain.

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that a preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD) exists several years or more prior to the overt manifestation of clinical symptoms and is characterized by subtle neuropsychological and brain changes. Identification of individuals prior to the development of significant clinical symptoms is imperative in order to have the greatest treatment impact by maintaining cognitive abilities and preserving quality of life. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers considerable promise as a non-invasive tool for detecting early functional brain changes in asymptomatic adults. In fact, evidence to date indicates that functional brain decline precedes structural decline in preclinical samples. Therefore, fMRI may offer the unique ability to capture the dynamic state of change in the degenerating brain. This review examines the clinical utility of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI in those at risk for AD as well as in early AD. We provide an overview of fMRI findings in at-risk groups by virtue of genetic susceptibility or mild cognitive decline followed by an appraisal of the methodological issues concerning the diagnostic usefulness of fMRI in early AD. We conclude with a discussion of future directions and propose that BOLD-fMRI in combination with cerebral blood flow or diffusion techniques will provide a more complete accounting of the neurovascular changes that occur in preclinical AD and thus improve our ability to reliably detect early brain changes prior to disease onset.},

Compared with controls and aMCI, AD was associated with opposing connectivity effects in the DMN (decreased) and frontal networks (enhanced). The only RS abnormality found in aMCI patients compared with controls was a precuneus connectivity reduction in the DMN. RS fMRI group differences were only partly related to gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the mean executive network connectivity was positively associated with frontal-executive and language neuropsychological scores. These results suggest that AD is associated with an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks, which extends well beyond the DMN. In AD, the limited resources of the DMN may be paralleled, in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency, by an increased prefrontal connectivity. A medial parietal RS fMRI signal change seems to be present since the early phase of AD.},

	abstract = {Normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cause profound changes in the brain’s structure and function. AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer’s disease. We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity—seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease.},

From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44\% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44\%.

However, functional connectivity between the hippocampus and other brain regions remains unclear in AD. Here, we employ a resting state functional MRI (fMRI) to examine changes in hippocampal connectivity comparing 13 patients with mild AD versus 13 healthy age-matched controls. Hippocampal connectivity was investigated by examination of the correlation between low frequency fMRI signal fluctuations in the hippocampus and those in all other brain regions. We found that functional connectivity between the right hippocampus and a set of regions was disrupted in AD; these regions are: medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), right inferotemporal cortex, right cuneus extending into precuneus, left cuneus, right superior and middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also found increased functional connectivity between the left hippocampus and the right lateral prefrontal cortex in AD. In addition, rightward asymmetry of hippocampal connectivity observed in elderly controls was diminished in AD patients. The disrupted hippocampal connectivity to the MPFC, vACC and PCC provides further support for decreased activity in “default mode network” previously shown in AD. The decreased connectivity between the hippocampus and the visual cortices might indicate reduced integrity of hippocampus-related cortical networks in AD. Moreover, these findings suggest that resting-state fMRI might be an appropriate approach for studying pathophysiological changes in early AD.},

	abstract = {Objective
Study of brain network on the basis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided promising results to investigate changes in connectivity among different brain regions because of diseases. Graph theory can efficiently characterize different aspects of the brain network by calculating measures of integration and segregation.
Method
In this study, we combine graph theoretical approaches with advanced machine learning methods to study functional brain network alteration in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Support vector machine (SVM) was used to explore the ability of graph measures in diagnosis of AD. We applied our method on the resting-state fMRI data of twenty patients with AD and twenty age and gender matched healthy subjects. The data were preprocessed and each subject’s graph was constructed by parcellation of the whole brain into 90 distinct regions using the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas. The graph measures were then calculated and used as the discriminating features. Extracted network-based features were fed to different feature selection algorithms to choose most significant features. In addition to the machine learning approach, statistical analysis was performed on connectivity matrices to find altered connectivity patterns in patients with AD.
Results
Using the selected features, we were able to accurately classify patients with AD from healthy subjects with accuracy of 100\%.
Conclusion
Results of this study show that pattern recognition and graph of brain network, on the basis of the resting state fMRI data, can efficiently assist in the diagnosis of AD.
Significance
Classification based on the resting-state fMRI can be used as a non-invasive and automatic tool to diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease.},

	abstract = {Indexing and classification tools for Content Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) have been penetrating the universe of medical image analysis. They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal “knowledge diffusion” process, when methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French epidemiological study: “Bordeaux dataset”. The experimental results show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 \% and 85 \% for ADNI subset and “Bordeaux dataset” respectively. For the most challenging group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach accuracies of 78.22 \% and 72.23 \% for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification results by 9 \% in average for these three categories. Results demonstrate very promising classification performance and simplicity compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric AD diagnosis methods.},

In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG and Inception are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is re-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image entropy to select the most informative slices for training.

In this paper, we used convolutional neural network to classify Alzheimer's brain from normal healthy brain. The importance of classifying this kind of medical data is to potentially develop a predict model or system in order to recognize the type disease from normal subjects or to estimate the stage of the disease. Classification of clinical data such as Alzheimer's disease has been always challenging and most problematic part has been always selecting the most discriminative features. Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimer's subjects from normal controls where the accuracy of test data on trained data reached 96.85\%. This experiment suggests us the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification is most powerful method to distinguish clinical data from healthy data in fMRI.

Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks.

Objective
To determine the effect of 2 different dual tasks on gait variability in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared with control subjects.
Design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Memory clinic at a university hospital.
Participants
Older adults with MCI (n=43) and cognitively normal control subjects (n=25) from the community. Gait was assessed under single (usual walking) and dual tasking (naming animals and subtracting serial 7s), using an electronic walkway.
Interventions
Not applicable.
Main Outcome Measures
The dependent variable was the coefficient of variation of gait variability, a marker of gait stability and an established risk factor for falls. Two-way repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to examine main effects (group, task) and their interaction.
Results
A significant difference was found within and between groups (P=.016) of increasing gait variability as dual-task complexity increased. Gait velocity decreased within groups as dual-task complexity increased. The magnitude of increased gait variability across tasks was greater for the MCI group (2.68\%– 9.84\%) than for the control group (1.86\%–3.74\%), showing a significant between-group difference (P=.041).
Conclusions
Dual-task load significantly increased gait variability in the MCI group compared with the control group, an effect that was larger than the changes in gait velocity. The magnitude of this impairment on gait stability was related to the complexity of the dual task applied. Our findings help to explain the high risk of falls recently described in older adults with MCI, and may help in the identification of fall risk in cognitively impaired persons.},

	abstract = {An introduction to a broad range of topics in deep learning, covering mathematical and conceptual background, deep learning techniques used in industry, and research perspectives.“Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.”—Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceXDeep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

	doi = {10.1109/5.726791},
	abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

A promising alternative is to fine-tune a CNN that has been pre-trained using, for instance, a large set of labeled natural images. However, the substantial differences between natural and medical images may advise against such knowledge transfer. In this paper, we seek to answer the following central question in the context of medical image analysis: Can the use of pre-trained deep CNNs with sufficient fine-tuning eliminate the need for training a deep CNN from scratch? To address this question, we considered four distinct medical imaging applications in three specialties (radiology, cardiology, and gastroenterology) involving classification, detection, and segmentation from three different imaging modalities, and investigated how the performance of deep CNNs trained from scratch compared with the pre-trained CNNs fine-tuned in a layer-wise manner. Our experiments consistently demonstrated that 1) the use of a pre-trained CNN with adequate fine-tuning outperformed or, in the worst case, performed as well as a CNN trained from scratch; 2) fine-tuned CNNs were more robust to the size of training sets than CNNs trained from scratch; 3) neither shallow tuning nor deep tuning was the optimal choice for a particular application; and 4) our layer-wise fine-tuning scheme could offer a practical way to reach the best performance for the application at hand based on the amount of available data.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia is a neurodegenerative brain order that has currently no cure for it. Hence, early diagnosis of such disease using computer-aided systems is a subject of great importance and extensive research amongst researchers. Nowadays, deep learning or particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) is getting more attention due to its state-of-the-art performances in variety of computer vision tasks such as visual object classification, detection and segmentation. Several recent studies, that have used brain MRI scans and deep learning have shown promising results for diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. However, most common issue with deep learning architectures such as CNN is that they require large amount of data for training. In this paper, a mathematical model PFSECTL based on transfer learning is used in which a CNN architecture, VGG-16 trained on ImageNet dataset is used as a feature extractor for the classification task. Experimentation is performed on data collected from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The accuracy of the 3-way classification using the described method is 95.73\% for the validation set.},

	abstract = {Visual inspection of neuroimagery is susceptible to human eye limitations. Computerized methods have been shown to be equally or more e↵ective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract hand–crafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross–domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC). Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classiﬁcation performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches.},
